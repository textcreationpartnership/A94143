            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have undertaken a Subject which in it ſelfe cannot be enough commended: in the handling whereof I have oppoſed no man out of any Singularity or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of contradiction, but onely for the love of truth; which I doubt not but I may do, and yet arrogate to my ſelf nothing more then is meet. Hiſtory is a Subject commended I know by the moſt, as being the Herald of Antiquity, the Light of Truth, the Life of Memory, and the Eye of the World: but Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology is little eſteemed, few prize it according to the true value, and yet 'tis indeed the very Eye of Hiſtory. <hi>Alter Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae oculus,</hi> as one ſpeaketh. And ſo another, ſaying, <hi>Nulla historia lucem habet ſine temporum ſerie:</hi> No hiſtory hath Light without a right order of the Times. Nor can it be thought the Holy Spirit of God would be ſo exact in noting the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115738:8"/>Times (even to Moneths, Weeks, and Dayes) in the ſacred ſtory, if the carefull account of them were not to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Sure I am, it can be no ſmall confirmation of a mans faith, concerning the threatnings and promiſes of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of the whole Scripture, when he ſeeth how the Prophecies at their determined times came to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and how the linking of one period with another makes up ſuch a chaine as cannot but minde us of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in his Government of the World, eternally foreknowing, and wiſely diſpoſing of what ſhould be acted in future times.
<note place="margin">Math. 24.15.</note> 
                        <hi>Our Saviour Chriſt mentioning the Abomination of Deſolation, ſpoken of by</hi> Daniel <hi>the Prophet,</hi> ſaith; <hi>Let him that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth underſtand.</hi>

Beſides which, the exact handling of theſe things makes it manifeſt that the Being of the World hapned not by chance, or was from Eternity, but that it had a beginning, and doth tend alſo towards an ending. So alſo the Prophecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the comming of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> being hereby found to be accompliſhed, diſcovers to the <hi>Jews</hi> their blindneſſe, and ſtirs them up to minde their Converſion: I might ſay more, and ſhew how Scriptures ſeemingly jarring in point of time are here reconciled; many places cleared, eſpecially in the Books of the <hi>Judges, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Eſther, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel:</hi> but let this ſuffice, and be enough to ſhew that there is great dignity and worth in Chronologie; I think not my paines therefore to be ill employed, nor ſhall doubt of their candid accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the curteous and ingenuous, to whom I commit them; hoping they may give ſatisfaction to them, ſearching for truth as I have done. This is all that in the firſt Chapter I thought good to mention, having written it on purpoſe to be a Preface to the reſt: Here therefore I put an end to it, and am to proceed now as followeth.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. Shewing in what part of the yeare the world was created.</head>
                     <p>IN the account of times it is very neceſſary that there ſhould be a propoſed point or marke from whence every reckoning may take beginning; that thereby the years which have ſeverall times of beginning may the more truly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and compared among themſelves. Wherefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be amiſſe to ſet downe ſomething concerning the time of the yeare wherein the world began; eſpecially ſeeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chronologers it is uſuall to referre their accounts ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the current yeare of the worlds Creation, or of our Saviours birth. And now, concerning this, there be chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three opinions.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="section">
                        <head>SECT. I.</head>
                        <p>For firſt, <hi>Mercator</hi> and ſome others maintaine that the world was created in the very time of the Summer Solſtice, and that in the beginning of time, the Sunne entring <hi>Leo,</hi> gave beginning to the year.</p>
                        <p>This (as is thought) was firſt hatched among the Prieſts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who obſerving the River <hi>Nilus</hi> to over-flow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Summer Solſtice, adored it for a God, eſteeming the time of its inundation for an infallible beginning of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine actions in things created; and thereupon, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning likewiſe of the year at the time of the worlds Creation.</p>
                        <p>But if this were the onely cauſe, we may not unfitly ſay, that it was folly and ſuperſtition which firſt ſet this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on abroach, and therefore he is worthy of blame who will goe about to maintaine it. And although <hi>Mercator</hi> in his Chronologie ſeems to alleadge ſome other reaſons, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to uphold his ſhare in it, yet his chiefe reaſon is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: for it is grounded upon that which is not granted,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115738:9"/>
                           <hi>viz.</hi> that the flood ſhould end about <hi>July,</hi> becauſe in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Moneth, which he ſuppoſeth to be <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June,</hi> when the Olive beginneth to put forth, the Dove brought greene Olive leaves unto Noah into the Arke.</p>
                        <p>To which it is anſwered that the word in <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11. which he taketh to ſignifie green leaves, may (as Expoſitors wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) as well be taken for Branches, even ſuch as hath been uſed to make bowers with: which (according to the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Septuagint) is expreſſed by a word ſignifying a dry ſtalk.
<note place="margin">Dr. Willet.</note> And ſo ſaith a * Doctor in his <hi>Hexapla</hi> upon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> Chapter the firſt, queſtion the 17. that the word in the Originall is <hi>Gnalce,</hi> which (as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> tranſlateth it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) ſignifies the branches of Olives, and in the Septuagint it is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> a ſtalk without leaves.</p>
                        <p>That therefore which the <hi>Dove</hi> brought, might be ſome branch of the Olive tree rather then the leaves, and ſo might the Flood end at the dead time of the yeer rather then when things were freſh and flouriſhing.</p>
                        <p>But admit that the ſtalke or branch had leaves on it, yet it proves not that it was about <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June,</hi> when the <hi>Dove</hi> found and brought it; becauſe it is
<note place="margin">Plin. lib. 16. cap. 20.</note> recorded of the Olive, that ſhe Ioſeth not her leaves as other trees doe, but is green and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing all the yeer. Such leaves therefore as it had before the flood, it might have after the flood: for if they were new ones, they muſt needs ſpring out in ſeven dayes; becauſe the <hi>Dove</hi> was ſent out but ſeven dayes before, returning then as a Creature diſconſolate, not finding any thing at all.</p>

                        <p>Another opinion, is, that it was created in Autumne, and that the Sunne (who is the Index of time, by whoſe revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we account our years) began his courſe in <hi>Libra</hi> about the 26. day of <hi>October,</hi> if the reckoning be reduced to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian yeare which is now in uſe.</p>
                        <p>Unto which opinion I gave my aſſent, when I firſt wrote of theſe things, and had for it (as I then thought) many ſtrong and forcible reaſons, which I did illuſtrate and lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115738:9"/>at large, building much upon the teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> whom <hi>Calviſius</hi> and others ſtrengthen from the words of the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> upon the firſt book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> the eighth Chapter, at the ſecond verſe: But was moſt of all drawne to be of their ſide by joyning with them in their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe texts of <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Exodus,</hi> Chap. 23. verſe 16. and Chap. 34, verſe 22, <hi>where firſt the Iſraelites are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to obſerve the feaſt of in gathering in the end of the yeare, when they had gathered in their labours out of the field; that is, the feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles in the ſeventh moneth: and ſecondly are taught, that this feaſt was in</hi> revolutione anni, ſive evolvendo anno, <hi>in the revlution of the year or when the year is wheeled about.</hi> By which a man would think that the yeare both ended and began again, about the feaſt of Tabernacles: and that though the firſt moneth of the year mentioned, and ſo commanded to be called, in <hi>Exodus</hi> the 12, at the comming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was reckoned from the Spring; yet the yeare naturally did nevertheleſſe begin from Autumne, in the ſeventh moneth from that firſt.</p>

                        <p>Howbeit upon more mature deliberation, I think them to be in the right, who reckon from the Spring, and do therefore fairely lay downe my former Tenet. For firſt, that moneth which began from thence, is (in the 12. chap. of <hi>Exodus</hi>) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely called the <hi>Firſt moneth of the yeare,</hi> as cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The firſt moneth, not as then appointed, but confirmed, for any thing that the text affirmeth to the contrary; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Originall doth not ſay directly, let it be the firſt moneth; it is every whit as right to underſtand the verb which is wanting, to be as well a verb of the Indicative, as of the Imperative mood, &amp; of the preſent as wel as of the future tenſe. Whereupon it will alſo follow, that <hi>Moſes</hi> (by Gods appointment) ordaining this moneth to be the firſt moneth of the year, doth make no new inſtitution, but reneweth the old account of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> which was diſcontinued in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> by reaſon that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> indeed began their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from their moneth <hi>Ptho,</hi> in Autumne, when <hi>Nilus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115738:10"/>againe into his river, as well as from that time which <hi>Mercator</hi> taketh up, when it firſt began to overflow: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this word <hi>to you,</hi> calls them back from the cuſtome of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> For that manner of reckoning which they had ſeen there, was none of theirs: and therefore they being come from thence, muſt know that it belongs to them to reckon thus, for <hi>To you this is the beginning of moneths,</hi> Exod. 12.2.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Joſephus</hi> therefore had ſmall cauſe to ſay that <hi>Moſes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the old ancient order of the year; eſpecially, ſeeing he himſelfe doth likewiſe (in a manner) affirme, how that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> reckoning from Autumne, doe but as the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did: Beſides, <hi>Joſephus</hi> having an eye to the beginning of the years of Jubilee, which began from the ſeventh moneth after that moneth which <hi>Moſes</hi> told them was the firſt month of the year, was the readier to think (as the modern <hi>Jews</hi> ſince his time have alſo done) that in regard of Eccleſiaſticall affaires the beginning of the year was altered at the coming out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but the old ancient beginning ſtood ſtill and was regarded in their affaires of civill nature: whereupon he ſaith that <hi>Moſes</hi> did innovate nothing from the ancient rite concerning the diſpoſing of the year for buyings and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. In which words (me thinks) he doth a little ſtumble both himſelfe and ſuch as ſtick to his teſtimony, in regard that the Nundinations and things of that nature appertained to the Jubilee, which was not inſtituted untill afterwards. I finde therefore little in <hi>Joſephus</hi> concerning this to build upon.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt alſo is in this the ſame in effect with <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and is ſo much the more invalid, by how much the reckoning of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> is againſt it: both of which Nations accounted from the Spring, and might firſt learne it from the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> (<hi>Terah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>) who we are ſure lived for a great while together in <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> and taught them (at leaſt <hi>Abraham</hi> did) the knowledge of the Stars, for ſo <hi>Beroſus</hi> mentions: and ſucceſſively ever ſince Aſtrologers have accounted the revolution of the World from the Suns entrance into <hi>Aries;</hi> where (in token of the beginning of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115738:10"/>year) the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſet their God <hi>Mithras</hi> holding in his hand a naked ſword.</p>
                        <p>Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, to ſhew that it was Spring when the World was made, the Scripture ſpeaketh thus, <hi>Hic vobis initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um menſium;</hi> this is to you the beginning of moneths. Nor doe other of the Fathers (<hi>Euſebius, Baſil, Athanaſius, Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem, Auguſtine, Gregorie Nazianzene, Damaſcene, Beda, Iſiodore,</hi>) beſides late writters (<hi>Luther, Johannes Lucidus, Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Lydiat, Polanus, Perkins, Willet, Alstedius</hi> and others) but affirme as much. <hi>Beda</hi> makes mention of a Synod holden in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> by <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> in which was agreed that the World was made in the Spring: yea, and among the <hi>Jews, Rabbi Joſhua</hi> doth earneſtly defend the ſame Tenet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another great <hi>Rabbi,</hi> who would that it ſhould be made in Autumne.</p>
                        <p>And further, whereas God bleſſed the creatures, and bid them increaſe and multiply, which bleſſing preſently tooke effect, who knoweth not that for moſt kinds of creatures, eſpecially the fiſh and foule, the fitteſt time to engender and encreaſe is the Spring?</p>
                        <p>The time of the creation is alſo found from the Hiſtory of the Flood, which began on the ſeventeenth day of the ſecond moneth of the year; which ſecond moneth agrees not to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne, but to the Spring: For firſt, by comparing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Moneths here ſpecified, with that order which God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> command to put in practice, it will well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the firſt moneth was reckoned from the Spring; becauſe it cannot be ſhewed in any place of Scripture, when the moneths are reckoned in their orders, (as the firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, fifth, &amp;c.) that they take beginning from any other time. So that as <hi>Moſes</hi> accounted the firſt, ſecond, third, fourth fifth, &amp;c. from <hi>Niſan</hi> which began in the Spring, in like manner did <hi>Noah</hi> reckon from the ſame time. And whereas I heretofore thought that this order of the moneths could prove nothing, becauſe not above foure of the moneths were knowne to have names till after the Captivity; and muſt therefore either not be reckoned at all, or elſe be reckoned in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115738:11"/>order according to their number, from whenceſoever the reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning begun: I finde it ſince to be no perfect anſwer: For even thoſe foure are mentioned as well by the order of their number, as by their name, even before the Captivity, when they had names to be called by, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> chap. 6. and chap. 8. Nor was it but ſo likewiſe, afterwards, both with them and ſome of the reſt,
<note place="margin">1 Mac. 4.53. and chap. 9.54.</note> as in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and the books of <hi>Maccabees</hi> may be ſeen.</p>
                        <p>And then ſecondly, if it had been Autumne when the Flood began, the Flood continuing much about a juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven year, it muſt needs end at ſuch a time as a man would think ſhould be neither fit for the creatures to encreaſe and multiply, nor the earth (in thoſe Northern parts of the world where the Ark reſted) to be dryed up, no nor for the graſſe and herbs to grow for food, the winter comming on ſo ſoon. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> therefore is ſo fully reſolved concerning this, that <hi>It is not to be doubted</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but that this ſecond moneth was in the Spring timewhen things encreaſe and grow, the fields bring forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that God then ſent the flood upon the wicked, when their greif ſhould be the greater, to be puniſhed in their abundance.</hi> Which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that holy Father ſeems to be warranted from the words of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.37. For it is true according to Chriſts own Teſtimony recorded there, that they of the old world were taken even in the midſt of all their mirth.</p>
                        <p>And as for the foreſaid Texts alledged out of <hi>Exodus</hi> they may (as ſome thinke) be anſwered thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that the yeare as well as the moneth is naturally divided into two cheife parts: the one whereof is of the year beginning or coming in; the other of the year ending or going out: for by this the year ſeems to be compared to a Ring, which by a diameter is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two ſemicircles, inſomuch that when one halfe is ended by the courſe of the Sun from one point of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter to the other; the other part muſt needs be taken for the converſion or returne untill the Sun be come againe to the firſt point where as one year endeth, the other begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Now then the ſeventh moneth is fitly called the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or returne; becauſe the firſt halfe is then at an end,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115738:11"/>and the year entred upon his revolution or returne, and ſo the feaſt of the Tabernacles (kept alwayes in that moneth) was in <hi>exitu anni,</hi> in the going out of the year.</p>
                        <p>Which anſwer to that Text I doe in ſome ſort approve, and could be willing to think it might fully ſatisfie, if the year conſiſted of no more then two parts: but becauſe the year is divided into four quarters or <hi>Tekupha's,</hi> called (as I ſhall ſhew you afterward) <hi>the returnes of the year,</hi> I think it a more perfect anſwer to ſay; It is called <hi>the end and returne of the year,</hi> not becauſe it met then with the naturall head thereof, but becauſe all the fruit of the year was gathered in, and ſeed time began anew: And ſo it is with us, the Autumne is counted the beginning of the year for matters of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry; and yet we in the computation of our years begin in the Spring at the Annuntiation. The year of Jubilee indeed began now, I meane at Autumne: but for all that, the moneth wherein it began, is not called the firſt moneth but the ſeventh, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.10.</p>
                        <p>And furthermore, whereas it is uſually objected that the trees were created with ripe fruits on them, and that the world was therefore made in Autumne: it is anſwered; that in the Eaſtern parts of the world, ſome fruits are ripe in the Spring as well as in Autumne, as is ſeen by the Harveſt of the Jews, which was never long after Eaſter. And without queſtion Paradiſe had the preheminence to be the beſt place that the world afforded, and might therefore have ripe fruits ſooner then the Jews had their yearely Harveſt. To which may be added, that the <hi>Arabians, Syrians,</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> do not begin their year from Autumn, but from the Spring, as <hi>Simplicius</hi> witneſſeth upon the fifth book of <hi>Ariſtotles Phyſicks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But they have further to object,
<label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                           </label> that the Law is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeverall Sections, which were all of them read over once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year, the firſt whereof by an old ancient cuſtome began alwayes from Autumne: which was to ſhew that there was the right beginning of the year.</p>
                        <p>But to this learned <hi>Langius</hi> hath fully anſwered; ſaying
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115738:12"/>that neither was it ever defined of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> nor of any of the Judges, how much of the Law ſhould be read on any Sabbath, nor from what time of the year the reading of the Law ſhould begin againe. It was indeed commanded of <hi>Moſes</hi> that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have the words and book of the Law alwayes before their eyes: but of that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique reading it in the Synagogues, according to ſeverall Sections &amp; Diviſions, he ſpake not a word. King <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> is found to be the firſt who ſent forth his Princes, to whom he joyned Levits in Commiſſion, who going through all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Judah,</hi> taught the people in the Law of God: for they alwayes had the Book of the Law about them, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17.7, 8, &amp;c. From whence is manifeſt, that in thoſe times there were no ordinary Praelections or Lectures thereof. But after the Captivity, more like it is, that <hi>Eſdars</hi> (that expert Scribe) divided the Law into parts, and inſtituted that order of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them which is ſtill obſerved: and becauſe when he began to read, it was the firſt day of the ſeventh moneth, as may be ſeen, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.2. therefore ever after, the reading began from thence: and yet then, to ſpeak truely, it is hard to ſay what preciſe proportion <hi>Ezra</hi> obſerved for one reading, ſeeing (as the third verſe ſheweth) he read therein from morning untill mid-day; and might therefore, rather afterwards then now, proportion the whole into ſeverall parts, if at all it were done by him.</p>
                        <p>I conclude therefore, that (notwithſtanding the ſtrongeſt and beſt objections to the contrary) the world began at the Spring time of the year, and that on the fourth day of the firſt Week the Sun was in the fourth degree of <hi>Aries:</hi> which fourth day, according to the <hi>Julian</hi> year, was on the ſeven and twentieth day of <hi>April;</hi> on which day the Sun was created, and ſet in the Firmament of Heaven, as ſhall be further ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterwards.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>That the</hi> Jews, <hi>as well of old, as of later Times, accounted their Moneths by the courſe of the MOON.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT is a plaine and manifeſt truth, approved by teſtimony undeniable, that in that age of the World in which our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt lived, the Jews reckoned their moneths by the courſe of the Moon; and that on the fourteenth day of that Moone which they accounted for the firſt moneth, their <hi>Paſcha</hi> or <hi>Eaſter</hi> was. This we have recorded by an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique Author, as ancient as thoſe times; I meane <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> in his book of the life of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Who ſpeaking there of the firſt moneth, and of the <hi>Paſchal ſolemnity</hi> obſerved in it, ſaith, as the words ſound in the Latine: <hi>Hoc ipſo menſe, circa decimam quartam diem, cum plenus jam orbis Lunae futurus eſt, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatis ſolemne celebratur;</hi> that is, In this very moneth, about the fourteenth day, when the Moon ſhall be at the full, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feaſt of the Paſſeover is kept. And in another place, ſpeaking of the time when the Moneths began, he declareth that their beginning was from the firſt fight or viſion of the Moon, <hi>viz. cum Sol incipit ſenſibili ſplendore Lunam illuſtrare;</hi> When the Sun begins to enlighten the Moon ſo as ſhe may be perceived. And ſo alſo he did in the place firſt mentioned, calling that the <hi>Novilunium, Quod Synodum Lunarem, ſive Novae cujuſdam Lunae, ſequitur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this Authour I may joyne <hi>Joſephus,</hi> wherein is recorded that the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth of the year, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<note n="*" place="margin">Here <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth <hi>Niſau</hi> to be the firſt moneth of the year.</note>

                     <p>And as this was the courſe and account of the Moneths in thoſe times, ſo in the dayes before; for when <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Syrach</hi> lived (which was 230. years before Chriſt) there was no other Index for the appointed Feaſts on certaine and ſet dayes of the moneth, but what the Moon afforded. He
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115738:13"/>therefore ſaith, <hi>à Luna ſignum eſſe diei feſti:</hi> From the Moon is the ſigne of a feaſtivall day, <hi>Ecclus</hi> 43.7.</p>
                     <p>The Author of the third book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> Ch. 1. goeth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for ſpeaking of <hi>Joſiah's</hi> ſolemne Paſſeover, he ſaith it was celebrated on the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe of the Moon; as in <hi>Hieroms</hi> Bible may be ſeen. The like he repeateth afterwards of another Paſſeover, Chap. 7. verſe 10.</p>
                     <p>Higher then thus goeth <hi>Rabbi Moſes, Ben Maimon,</hi> affirming that the Moneths of the year were the Moneths of the Moon, and that in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time they were ſo accounted; evermore begining (as <hi>Philo</hi> before had noted) from the firſt ſight or viſion of the Moon. For the antient manner was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> even till the yeare of Chriſt 500. about which time the <hi>Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes Gemarae</hi> ceaſed, as <hi>Petavius</hi> noteth.</p>
                     <p>And hereupon it is that learned <hi>Langius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ritum hunc de ſanctificanda Neomenia à temporibus antiquiſſimis &amp; Moſis ipſius deducit Maimon, quem ſemper à Judaeis obſervatum fuiſſe docet, quamdiu Sapientes erant in terra-Iſraelis: hoc eſt, ut ipſe explicat, ad tempora Abai &amp; Rabba. Aben Ezra</hi> likewiſe ſaith, upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. That the Lord gave commandement in the Law of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Feaſt at the appointed time. <hi>Dicit enim, Obſerva men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem Abib, ut facias Peſah Domino; &amp; ſi tempus Abib non fuerit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventum in medio menſis: faciemus Paſcha menſe ſequente.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But higher then all theſe, doth the teſtimony of <hi>Elias Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiarius</hi> bring us; who (as he is cited by that famous and illuſtrious Antiquarie M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Selden, in his accerptis</hi>) ſaith, <hi>Praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum hoc ſanctificandi Lunam exstabat ſeculis antiquiſſimis, temporibus Noachi &amp; Abrahami patris nostri.</hi> That is, This precept of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the Moon, was exſtant in the moſt ancient ages; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the times of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father.</p>
                     <p>And thus we have teſtimony for times high enough; even to the times wherein mention is firſt made of Moneths in holy Scripture, which teſtimonies will neither allow the Moneths in the hiſtory of the Flood to be according to the courſe of the Sunne, nor grant that the <hi>Jewes</hi> made uſe of the Period of <hi>Calippus</hi> after the times of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſometimes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115738:13"/>taught; nor that in Chriſts time they uſed a <hi>Quaterdenarian Cycle,</hi> as <hi>Petavius</hi> would prove from <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> For as I ſaid before, according to the witneſſe of the forecited authors, the ancient manner was to begin the Moneth from the firſt ſight or viſion of the Moon ſanctifying that day; <hi>Salomon</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not ſo much as lay the foundation of the Temple on the firſt, but on the ſecond day of the Moneth, becauſe the firſt was holy. For as God appointed a time for his day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and weekly worſhip, ſo he appointed generall Feaſts for his monethly and yearly worſhip: He therefore inſtituted the New Moons, and firſt day of every year to be accordingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Blow the Trumpet (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) in the New Moon: in the time appointed, on our ſolemn feaſt day. For this was a ſtatute for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a law of the God of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Pſal.</hi> 81.3, 4. By which he meaneth the feaſt of Trumpets, commanded to be celebrated on the firſt day of the ſeventh Moneth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.24. And in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> this is certain, that after Chriſts time the Moon was trodden under foot by the Woman cloathed with the <hi>Sunne, Revel.</hi> 12.1. By which is ſignified That that typicall worſhip which for the dayes thereof in the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had been regulated by the courſe of the Moon, was now in the Chriſtian Church, through the revealing of Chriſt laid proſtrate, aboliſhed and gone: the Woman therefore treadeth the Moon under her feet. Nor doth the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> again but juſtify this Lunar account, ſaying; God appointed the Moon <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>And ſo indeed it is; For in Scripture a moneth is called in the Hebrew tongue <hi>Iaerach,</hi> from <hi>Jareach Luna.</hi> And in Greeke the word is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The moneth likewiſe is ſomtimes in the Hebrew called <hi>Hodes</hi> or <hi>Chodeſch;</hi> which word doth properly ſignifie <hi>A renovation:</hi> ſo that <hi>Chodeſch</hi> is as much as <hi>Novilunium,</hi> or <hi>Renovatio lunae,</hi> in regard that on the firſt day thereof the Moon or moneth is renewed; in which ſence it is uſed in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.5. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſo by <hi>David Kimhi in libro Radicum,</hi> ſaying; <hi>&amp; voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Hodes ſive Novus, quia renovatur Luna in eo die.</hi> This word is alſo uſed for the whole moneth or ſpace of time that is from one renovation of the Moon to another; and hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an adject number of dayes paſt ſince the renovation; as <hi>prima luna, ſecunda ſuna, tertia luna, decima quarta luna, &amp;c.</hi> or elſe all the dayes are ſpoken of <hi>junctim</hi> and together; as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.20. ye ſhall not eat one day, nor two dayes, nor five dayes, neither ten dayes, nor twenty dayes: but even a moneth of dayes together.</p>

                     <p>The firſt whereof is,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                        </label> that if the moneths were Lunar, then in ſome years there muſt be thirteen moneths by reaſon of a moneth intercalar, called by the late Jews <hi>Veader</hi> or another <hi>Adar:</hi> But the Scripture makes no mention of any ſuch moneth; and therefore it may be concluded that of old there
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115738:14"/>was no other intercalar. <hi>Adar</hi> indeed is mentioned, both in the book of <hi>Heſter</hi> and elſewhere, but with no note of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſignifie which <hi>Adar</hi> it was: whereas if there were two <hi>Adars,</hi> there would have been ſomething added to know which of them was meant?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> And why ſo? it needed not,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> unleſſe there had been two <hi>Adars</hi> in every yeare: it was onely the <hi>Emboliſmall</hi> yeare which had two <hi>Adars,</hi> and not the Common year: Beſide which, know alſo this; we finde not in Scripture mention made of the thirtieth day of any moneth: ſhall we therefore conclude that no moneth had thirty dayes.</p>
                     <p>But that the vanity of this Objection may further appeare, this I ſay; that though the Scripture give no expreſſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moneth intercalar, yet ſome cleare footings of it may be ſeen there. As for example, in the Prophecy of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> at the firſt chapter, we finde that the Prophet had a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the fifth year of <hi>Jechoniah's</hi> Captivity, on the fifth day of the fourth moneth; and that after ſeven dayes more (as in the Chapters following is mentioned) he was commanded to lie on his left ſide 390. dayes, and to beare the ſins of Iſrael; after which he muſt lie on his right ſide 40. dayes more to beare the iniquity of Judah: and yet in the next year, on the fifth day of the ſixth moneth, he is ſaid to ſit againe among the Elders of Iſrael, chap. 8.1. Which could not be, unleſſe there were a moneth intercalar. For 40. dayes added to 390. doe make 430. which was a greater ſpace then could be any way from the twelfth day of the fourth moneth in the fifth year, to the fifth day of the ſixth moneth in the following year, unleſſe there were I ſay a moneth intercalar. Nor is this a ſtrange collection: for though theſe things perhaps were done in a viſion, yet that the Prophet might not tell the people a vaine viſion, nor deliver unto them an unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Prophecy, he muſt upon neceſſity lie hid and be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them ſo long as was the number of thoſe dayes. And indeed by putting this upon tryall by calculation, I find all fully cleared: For in the year of the Julian Period 4119. which was (as ſhall be afterwards proved) the fifth yeare of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115738:15"/>
                        <hi>Jechoniah's</hi> Captivity, the firſt day of <hi>Niſan</hi> was on the twentieth day of <hi>March;</hi> that year therefore muſt be <hi>annus Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolimaeus,</hi> and have thirteen moneths, or 384. dayes. For if it had been twelve moneths, or 354. dayes, then muſt the firſt of <hi>Niſan</hi> in the following year be on the eleventh of <hi>March,</hi> which could not be becauſe the fourteenth day thereof muſt not be before the Vernall Equinox, which then was on the twenty ſeventh day of <hi>March.</hi> And therefore the firſt of <hi>Niſan</hi> in the firſt of theſe two years was on the two and twentieth day of <hi>March;</hi> and in the next, on the tenth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill:</hi> ſo will there be ſpace enough by the fifth day of the ſixth moneth for all the dayes that the Prophet mentioneth to be accompliſhed; otherwiſe not. And thus I am glad of this objection, ſeeing it hath occaſioned a further confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moneths mentioned in Scripture to be Lunar.</p>
                     <p>The next thing objected,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                        </label> is the Hiſtory of the Flood, in which the moneths are found to be Solar; becauſe from the ſeventeenth day of the ſecond moneth, to the ſeventeenth day of the ſeventh moneth, were an hundred and fifty dayes: that is, five moneths of thirty dayes a peece.</p>
                     <p>Whereto I anſwer,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> that this hinders nothing, as afterward, when I come to ſpeake of the Flood, ſhall be plainly ſhewed. In the meane time this I adde, that twelve moneths of but thirty dayes a peece, amount in the whole to no more then 360. dayes: whereas in a full Solar year are more by five dayes and about ſix hours.</p>
                     <p>But to help this, they ſay that the old Patriarchs had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an epact of five dayes to be added to every year, or elſe that in every ſix years they made of thoſe five dayes an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calar moneth, to which alſo the ſix houres would reach in one hundred and twenty years: at which time they had alſo one moneth more then in their ordinary and common years. Now this time <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith was called by the name of <hi>Cheled,</hi> but doth very unaptly apply it to his purpoſe, as <hi>Petavius</hi> proves againſt him. For <hi>Cheled</hi> is no more applyable to an age of an hundred and twenty years, then to any other time or age, be it either more or leſſe; and is onely belonging to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115738:15"/>the time or age of mans life of what length ſoever it be: as may be ſeen in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5. where that very word is uſed. Nor again is that ſpace of an hundred and twenty years, in the ſixth chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſpoken for any other purpoſe then to ſhew the patience and long ſuffering of the Lord to the old World; which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calleth <hi>the waiting of God</hi> on them in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> while the <hi>Ark</hi> was preparing 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. Beſide which, this is alſo certaine; that if the ſixth year forementioned, were to have an intercalation in reſpect of the ſix hours, there would be two intercalar moneths to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; I meane in every one hundred and twentieth year, as is apparant by dividing the ſaid year by ſix. For 120. divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſix, hath twenty times ſix in it, and nothing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: whereupon will further follow, that in every one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twentieth year muſt be 420. dayes; which were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſurd to grant. Nay further, were it ſo that the ancient Patriarchs to avoid this abſurdity, ſhould be thought to reckon the five dayes at the end of every year, and defer the ſix houres till the one hundreth and twentieth year, by the which time thoſe houres amount to the ſpace of one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; yet ſtill is all built but upon conjecture: and that ſo weakly as there is little or no ſhew of probability in it; for if there were, then would there be from the Creation to the Flood no odd years, but equall diviſions of 120. years apiece: which we know is otherwiſe, in regard that when we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the year of the Flood by 120. we have 95. remaining. They therefore reckon far better who doe not onely account an Epact of five dayes at the end of every common year, but doe alſo intercalate a day in every fourth year, making the Epact then to be ſix, which in the common year was but five. Howbeit this ſtill is no better then meer conjecture, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not clearely be affirmed to be ſo indeed till after ages; and then, not ſo among the Jews, but among ſome other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for the moneth among the Jews was Lunar, as by the words uſed in Scripture for a moneth (beſide our other proofes) already mentioned, doth well appeare.</p>
                     <p>But thirdly,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                        </label> it is objected out of the ſeven and twentieth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115738:16"/>Chapter of the firſt book of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> that <hi>David</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed twelve Captaines of ordinary Legions to be over the Provinces, into which the whole body of the Kingdome was divided, and theſe to ſerve in their courſes ſeverally throughout the twelve moneths of the year. Or rather thus; King <hi>David</hi> appointed twelve Captains of ordinary Legions to be the life-guard of his perſon, and theſe to ſerve ſeverally in their courſes throughout the twelve moneths of the yeare; no more moneths being mentioned: for according to the number of the moneths, ſo was the number of the Captains. <hi>Salomon</hi> likewiſe appointed as many Stewards to provide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the royal Family, and theſe (as the former) to ſerve ſeverally throughout the twelve moneths of the year; as in the fourth Chapter of the firſt book of the <hi>Kings</hi> may be ſeen. The year therefore in thoſe times had no more then twelve moneths: for if there were thirteen, then for one moneths ſpace, both the Kings perſon muſt be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of a Guard, and the royall Family deſtitute likewiſe of Proviſions for their ſuſtenance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scaliger</hi> I remember,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> once made this Objection, but afterwards (upon his better thoughts) he cryed out againſt it, ſaying; <hi>Ridicula est objectio,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Scal.</hi> in Iſag. can.</note> It is a ridiculous objection: and an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>qua pertinaces contendunt, menſem veterem Hebraeorum lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narem non fuiſſe.</hi> And indeed, he might well cry out againſt it: For this objection is the ſame in effect with that to which I anſwered firſt. And therefore this I ſay, that theſe Captaines and Officers for their number in relation to the twelve moneths of the year, were according to the courſe of the common and ordinary years which had no more then twelve moneths: but in the <hi>Emboliſmall</hi> year were 13. moneths never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe; and how that odd moneth was ſupplyed, is not at all in Scripture declared. The Jews ſay that the moneth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalar was eſteemed but as <hi>momentum temporis,</hi> a point of time, and in it they judged <hi>no civill</hi> matter: we may therefore be induced to think it probable, that he whoſe Office fell to the twelfth moneth in the common year, did likewiſe ſupply the ſervice of the thirteenth moneth in the <hi>Emboliſmall</hi> year,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115738:16"/>and yet in the inſtitution of their Offices no more be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned then every man to ſerve his moneth. For as <hi>Wolphius</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>certè major habenda fuit annorum communium ratio, quia plures ſint, quam Embolimaeorum.</hi> The like to which is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with us in our year: for whereas we intercalate a day in every fourth year; the day intercalated, and the day before it, are both eſteemed as one, both for matters of Law, Faires, and the like.</p>
                     <p>And thus is this objection likewiſe anſwered: here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude this Chapter.</p>

                     <p>This then is the true and naturall year, and in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called a year of dayes: as may be ſeen in <hi>Jere.</hi> 28.3.

                     <p>Expoſitours therefore have obſerved,
<note place="margin">See Ainſworth on <hi>Gen. c.</hi> 1. ver. 14. and Gibbens, c. 5. Queſt. 2.</note> that a year hath the name in the Hebrew from <hi>Shanah,</hi> ſignifying a changing or Iteration; which is in regard of the Suns returning after a years end, to the ſame point of heaven where it firſt began: even as the moneth is derived from <hi>Chodeſch,</hi> which ſignifieth to Renew; becauſe at the moneths end the Moon is againe renewed; as in the former chapter hath been proved. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it found in any place of Scripture, that theſe names or words are the one of them taken to ſignifie the other; but by the one is meant a year, and by the other a moneth. Although therefore the popular or vulgar year might be meaſured by moneths; commonly twelve, and ſometimes thirteen: yet the fixed and naturall year, by which the moneths were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes regulated, was meaſured by the courſe of the Sun, and was a year of dayes; as in that before mentioned out of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> well appeareth.</p>
                     <p>Now this year was evermore divided according to the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kupha's</hi> or <hi>Quarters</hi> of it; as is ſtill obſerved by the Jews to this very day: who being zealous to maintaine the Cuſtomes of their Anceſtors, doe not onely meaſure their moneths by the courſe of the Moon, but their year by the courſe of the Sun, which they divide by four <hi>Tekuph's</hi> or <hi>Quarters.</hi> The firſt whereof belonged to the firſt moneth, which was <hi>Abib,</hi> called afterward <hi>Niſan:</hi> the ſecond to the fourth moneth, called afterward <hi>Thamuz:</hi> the third to the ſeventh Moneth, called afterward <hi>Tiſri;</hi> and the fourth to the tenth moneth, called af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>Tebheth.</hi> So that on what day ſoever of our <hi>Julian</hi> year that <hi>Tekupha</hi> hapned which pointed out the Vernall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox, from thence muſt the year be reckoned as from its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall head; for there the laſt year ended and the next began.</p>
                     <p>Nor are theſe <hi>Tekuphah's</hi> but mentioned in the Scripture:

Only the <hi>Tekupha</hi> of the Winter Solſtice is not ſo plainly deſcribed; and yet ſome think it to be in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.1. But however, whether it be or no, it is not much materiall: for having three, the fourth is not to be denied; in regard that as one Equinox is oppoſite to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo is the one Solſtice alſo oppoſite to the other.</p>
                     <p>It was ſometimes the opinion of <hi>Joſeph Scaliger</hi> that onely one <hi>Tekupha</hi> could be found in Scripture: but percieving that to be an erronous conceit, he plainly ſaid <hi>Judaeos nihil antiquius habere Tekupharum, ſive quadrantum quatuor obſervatione.</hi> Againſt which, though <hi>Petavius</hi> excepteth, yet thus much I find in him, as a thing which he granteth, ſaying; <hi>Tekupha nihil ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud eſt quam Converſio, ſive cardo anni quadruplex, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 45. which is as much as he ſhall need to grant in this particular: for if the <hi>Tekupha</hi> be <hi>cardo anni quadruplex,</hi> then may we juſtly conclude it to be <hi>cardo anni, quando Sol primum quatuor ſignorum ingreditur, Arietis, Cancri, Librae, Capricorni.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Tekupha's</hi> in the beginning of the World, if they be reduced to the courſe of our <hi>Julian</hi> yeare, were, the firſt of them on the 23. day of <hi>April</hi> in the Evening, when the 24. day was begun according as the <hi>Jewes</hi> account; the ſecond on the 25. day of <hi>July;</hi> the third on the 27. day of <hi>October;</hi> the fourth and the laſt on the 25. day of <hi>January;</hi> by which I meane that there the fourth or laſt Quarter of the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and was not ended till the 23. day of <hi>April</hi> next after was finiſhed. And why they be not ſtill on thoſe dayes, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Equinoctiall and Solſtitiall points have anticipated and not kept their places on thoſe dayes and Moneths they were at the firſt: which anticipation is not in regard of any errour or irregularity that is in the motion of the Sun, but becauſe the <hi>Julian</hi> year agreeth not thereunto, but is a little
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115738:18"/>longer then of right it ſhould be: For the true Solar year (in the meane meaſure thereof) doth not conſiſt of 365. dayes and full ſix hours; but rather of 365. dayes five hours, 48 minutes, 39 ſeconds, and 41 thirds. By which length of the Tropicall year, we finde in one year an anticipation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven minutes, twenty ſeconds, and nineteen thirds: which though it be at the firſt but a little, will nevertheleſſe in many years amount to the number of no few dayes, as we ſee it doth. For by the end of 127 years will be twenty four hours gained, with thirteen thirds: thereby declaring that the day of the <hi>Vernall Equinox</hi> in the beginning of the World, even till 95 years were ended, was in the common years on the 23 day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> though it be now on the tenth day of <hi>March;</hi> and the <hi>Autumnall Equinox</hi> on the 27 day of <hi>October,</hi> though it be now on the 13 day of <hi>September:</hi> Thus I ſay it was in the common years, though in the Biſſextile one day ſooner.</p>
                     <p>And why I allow but ninty five years at the firſt for the alteration of a day, is not becauſe twenty four houres are gained in that time, but becauſe the time of the firſt <hi>Equinox</hi> was at the
<note n="*" place="margin">At wch. time the firſt day of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, reaching the very even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 2 <hi>c.</hi> day.</note> evening of the 23 day: And therefore though at the firſt, ninty five years will bring the <hi>Equinox</hi> to a new day according to the <hi>Julian</hi> account, which begins the day from Midnight; yet afterwards we muſt not reckon that theſe <hi>Tekupha's</hi> change their places ſo as to be on a new day after the ſame account, till the end of the 127 years after.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore (this rule obſerved) that the <hi>Tekupha's</hi> change their places one day by the end of 127 years, and muſt be therefore ſet either backward or forward, according to the time propounded wherein we ſeek them: which the late <hi>Jews</hi> not obſerving, have them now not in their right places, although by them they ſtill divide the year into four Quarters.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115738:20"/>from <hi>Charran,</hi> to the comming of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and doth containe the juſt number of 430. years.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is from the comming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> till King <hi>Salomon</hi> began the building of the Temple, in the fourth yeare of his reigne; and is a Period of 479. years compleat, or of 480. begunne.</p>

                     <p>The ſixth is from thence to the time that <hi>Zerobabell</hi> began againe to build it, in the ſecond yeare of <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia;</hi> and is a Period of 68. years and ſome dayes more.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh is from thence to the beginning of <hi>Daniels</hi> LXX. weeks, in the twentieth yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was againe fully reſtored, and the wals there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of built up and finiſhed by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in a ſtreight of time: this being a Period of 65. years, as ſhall be afterwards proved.</p>
                     <p>The eighth is from thence to the beginning of Chriſts Miniſtery, in the ſeventie and fourth <hi>Julian</hi> yeare, at the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne of the yeare of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period 4742. and is a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of 483. years: called by <hi>Daniel</hi> Seven weeks and Sixtie two weeks, as is recorded <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. Theſe ſeven and ſixtie two make ſixtie nine, and end at Autumne: but Chriſt was baptized on the ſixth of <hi>January</hi> before. In the beginning therefore of the ſeventieth (or laſt) week exactly, betweene the firſt and ſecond Paſſeover after his Baptiſme, when his <hi>Harbinger John</hi> had now finiſhed his meſſage, and was caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priſon, (a time preciſely and purpoſely noted in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall ſtory) Chriſt firſt began to preach in <hi>Galilee</hi> the Goſpell of the Kingdome, and proclaimed himſelfe to be the <hi>MESSIAH.</hi> For after <hi>John</hi> was put in Priſon, ſaith <hi>Marke</hi> 1.14.

                        </gap> The time is fulfilled (that is, as Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> expounds it, the laſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115738:20"/>Week of the ſeventy is come) and the Kingdome of God is at hand. From that time (ſaith <hi>Matthew cap.</hi> 4.17.) Jeſus began to preach, and to ſay, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand.</hi> This was that day whereof Chriſt himſelfe ſaid at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that that Scripture was fulfilled: The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is upon me becauſe he hath annointed me to preach the Goſpell to the poore, &amp;c. and to preach the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable year of the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18.19. This the time and place whence Saint <hi>Peter</hi> reckoned the beginning of Chriſts Prophecy in his Sermon to <hi>Cornelius:</hi> That word (ſaith he) which was publiſhed through out all <hi>Judea,</hi> and began from <hi>Galilee</hi> after the Baptiſme which <hi>John</hi> preached, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.37. Learned <hi>Scaliger</hi> alſo here hath well obſerved: For though he expound <hi>Daniels</hi> Weekes otherwiſe then I have done; yet this he ſaith, <hi>Dimidium autem Septimanae pertinet ad praedicatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Meſſiae, quod nemo ignorat:
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Scal. De E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. temp.</hi> lib. 6. edit. 1.</note> Praedicatio autem non a Baptiſmo incipit, quod hactenus omnibus perſuaſum fuit, ſed à vinculis Johannis Baptiſtae.</hi> Thus he; Who hereupon accounteth from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of <hi>John,</hi> to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, three yeares and a halfe; ſaying, <hi>A vinculis Johannis &amp; praedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one ad Reſurrectionem, anni tres cum ſemiſſe.</hi> And againe, <hi>Male hactenus tempus Praedicationis a Baptiſmo definitum.</hi> Thus in his firſt Edition: and in his ſecond, thus; <hi>Hinc incipit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>praedicatio Chriſti.</hi> Meaning that from the impriſonment of <hi>John,</hi> between the firſt and ſecond Paſſeover, was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſts preaching.</p>
                     <p>The ninth is from hence to the Paſſion of Chriſt, in the middle of this laſt week, and is a <hi>Period</hi> of three years and ſix moneths: For in the fourth year of this week (three years and an halfe after Chriſt Jeſus began his Prophecie) being made our High Prieſt, he offered himſelfe upon the Croſſe a Sacrifice for Sin, was dead, buried, and roſe again: Then aſcended up into heaven to be inſtalled, and to ſit at the right hand of God, and from thenceforth to reigne till he have ſubdued all his enemies under his feet. The time of this <hi>Period</hi> is confeſſed even by ſome among the Jewes: three years and a halfe the glory of God ſtood upon <hi>Mount Olivet</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115738:21"/>and preached, ſaying, <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near;</hi> as <hi>Rabbi Janna</hi> noteth.</p>
                     <p>The next to this is the tenth <hi>Period,</hi> and is from the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt to the end of the laſt <hi>Jubilee</hi> at the Autumne of the year foregoing the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> containing the number of thirty ſix years and and a halfe, or thereabout.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Reſt</hi> or <hi>Jubilee</hi> was the laſt that ever the Jews ſaw in their owne Land: for in the next year after it was ended, their Temple and City was utterly deſtroyed, and they themſelves caſt out, even in the year of the World 4074. and year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4783. Which year was alſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventieth year of Chriſt, according to the common account: the 115. Julian year, the ſecond year of Veſpaſian, and year of <hi>Rome</hi> built 822.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely the Providence of God herein is clearly ſeen: for as they began their account for <hi>Reſts</hi> and <hi>Jubilees</hi> in the laſt year of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſix moneths before they paſſed over <hi>Jordan,</hi> when they had conquered and began to poſſeſſe a part of that Land which God had given them for their Tribes to inherit: So in like manner this reckoning ended with them when the time was at hand that it ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them, and they caſt out till the time of the fulneſſe of the Gentiles come, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.24. And to this, in one place, doth <hi>Scaliger</hi> well agree: for though in his fifth book <hi>De emendatione Temporum,</hi> he begins this reckoning in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year after they came into <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet afterward in his ſeventh book, in his notes upon that Kalender called <hi>Computus Judaicus,</hi> he plainely ſaith; <hi>Ingreſſus Iſraelis in terram, est primus annus Septimanae.</hi> That is, the entrance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Land, is the firſt year of the Week: And ſo I account; for the firſt year of the firſt Week was not ended untill the Autumne next after <hi>Joſhua</hi> conducted the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This laſt year of <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3263.
<note place="margin">Num. 32.33.</note> when the Kingdome of <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and the Kingdome of <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> was conquered and given
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115738:21"/>to the children of <hi>Gad,</hi> and to the children of <hi>Ruben,</hi> and to halfe the tribe of <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> for a poſſeſſion: this conqueſt being about ſix moneths before <hi>Joſhua</hi> paſſed over <hi>Jordan,</hi> as <hi>Codoman</hi> noteth. The ſeventh year from hence incluſively, was therefore the beginning of the firſt year of <hi>Reſt,</hi> in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">And was the yeare of the Jews Period 2317.</note> 3269. And the ſeventh ſeven in like manner the firſt <hi>Iubilee,</hi> in the year of the ſame <hi>Period</hi> 3311. and year of the <hi>World</hi> 2602.</p>
                     <p>But if it be ſo, that every Seventh Seven muſt be a <hi>Iubilee,</hi>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                        </label> then how could the <hi>Iubilee</hi> be the fiftieth year.</p>
                     <p>Well enough:
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> For though the <hi>Iubilee</hi> fell alwayes into the Seventh Seven, yet nevertheleſſe it was the fiftieth year by including that year from whence the nine and forty exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively were accounted. For if the year of <hi>Iubilee</hi> be reckoned otherwiſe, the commandement concerning the years of <hi>Reſt</hi> for the Land could not be obſerved, but the whole order would be diſturbed, and the eighth year in every <hi>Iubilee</hi> be accounted for a year of <hi>Reſt,</hi> though it were indeed the firſt year of another Week, and a year in which they were to plow and ſow their ground, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.22. And that the manner of this reckoning may not ſeeme ſtrange, I will ſhew you in a word or two ſome few other preſidents, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the accounts are of the ſame nature. As for example: In Muſick we call that an eighth which excluſively is but ſeven, and no wayes eight but by including the two extream Notes. So alſo we call a Quartaine Ague, which hath not four dayes but by including the two ſick dayes. Chriſt likewiſe is ſaid to ariſe the third day; which could not be but by including as well the day of his death and buriall, as of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for on Friday he ſuffered; on Saturday was the Jewes Sabbath; and on Sunday in the morning (that being the firſt day of the week) he aroſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.21. <hi>Marke</hi> 16.2. And thus alſo it muſt be in the account for the year of <hi>Iubilee;</hi> which though it fall into the ſeventh Seven, is nevertheleſſe the fiftieth year by including the two extreme termes of the reckoning.</p>
                     <p>But if this be not enough for the cleare underſtanding of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115738:22"/>this difficulty, know we that here (as in all numbring) two things are to be conſidered: The parts numbered, and the manner of numbering. The parts numbered are three: namely, The two extreme termes; and the Middeſt, or what is between them: The manner of reckoning, that alſo is three-fold: The firſt is, when the middle numbers onely are accounted, and the two extreme termes excluded. The other, when the midſt with both the extreme termes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and under this manner of reckoning is contained whatſoever is expreſſed by any <hi>Ordinal number.</hi> The third and laſt is, when the midſt and one extreme terme onely is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the other (which is the firſt terme) being excluded: and under this forme of reckoning falleth the true account of all ſuch reckonings as are made by <hi>Cardinall numbers:</hi> For there be <hi>Ordinall numbers,</hi> and <hi>Cardinall numbers:</hi> By <hi>Cardinall numbers</hi> we inquire how many: And by <hi>Ordinall numbers</hi> we inquire of what <hi>Order</hi> the thing in queſtion is. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, If the queſtion be firſt concerning the number of years in a <hi>Jubilee;</hi> the anſwer then is, That there are but forty nine. But ſecondly, If the queſtion be, of what order is the yeare of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> the anſwer then is, That it falleth into the fiftieth year: Both which the holy text doth well expreſſe. <hi>For thou ſhalt number unto thee</hi> (ſaith God unto <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>ſeven Sabbaths of years, ſeven times ſeven years, and the ſpace of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sabbaths of years ſhall be unto thee forty and nine years,</hi> Levit. 25.8. In which words we have the firſt queſtion reſolved; namely, of the number of years in a <hi>Jubilee,</hi> That they are but forty nine. Then for the ſecond, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſheweth that alſo, at the tenth verſe, ſaying, <hi>And ye ſhall hallow the fiftieth year, &amp;c.</hi> Now that this fiftieth year was no other then the laſt year of the ſeventh Week, is plaine in regard that it is a queſtion whoſe reſolution is by <hi>Ordinall numbers,</hi> having the middle years with both the extreme termes included. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which learned <hi>Junius</hi> hath noted upon this text of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jun. edit. 2.</note> is worth the marking. <hi>[And thou ſhalt hallow the fiftieth year]</hi> that is, ſaith he, The fiftieth year incluſively conſidered, as the Jews uſe to reckon. By which I doubt not but he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ancient Jews, who had ſeen as well the obſervation
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115738:22"/>of the <hi>Jubilee,</hi> as of the Paſſeover, which <hi>Maimonides</hi> never did: and therefore the leſſe reaſon had <hi>Broughton</hi> and <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> to follow him in this particular; eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Period</hi> or <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Jews,

The like method is to be obſerved for finding the <hi>Sabbaticall</hi> years by dividing the year of the <hi>Iulian Period,</hi> in any year after the death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by ſeven: for if nothing remaine, then doth the Autumne of the year divided begin a year of <hi>Reſt</hi> or <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the Land: if one remaine, then about Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne the firſt year of Sowing beginneth; if two, then the ſecond: And ſo of all the other years, according to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth. As for example, the 150. year of the Grecians (when <hi>Eupator</hi> beſieged <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>) was in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4551. which being divided by ſeven, hath one remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and therefore that year was <hi>Sabathicall</hi> unto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne thereof, 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 6. <hi>Ioſeph.

                           <hi>Joſeph ontiq.</hi> lib. 13 c. 15.</note> it was in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4579. before the year of the Grecians 177. was ended: which year of the ſaid <hi>Period</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided by ſeven, hath alſo one remaining; and was therefore <hi>Sabbaticall</hi> untill the Autumne thereof.

                     <p>Some I know (and they no meane Authours) begin this account at that Diviſion of the Land which was in the ſeventh year of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> when <hi>Caleb</hi> was eighty five years old. But becauſe the Land was not fully divided then, nor the Tribes ſent home untill <hi>Ioſhua</hi> cauſed a further Diviſion to be made, and then ſent the Tribes home to their poſſeſſions, therefore have others deferred the head of this reckoning till then:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bonfrer.</hi> in Exod. 23.12.</note> that is, till the fourteenth year of <hi>Ioſhua. Bonfrerius</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Exodus,</hi> as he is cited by <hi>Philippus</hi> in his Chronology, obſerves the ſame; ſaying, <hi>Duae fuerunt diſtributiones terrae, &amp;c.</hi> There were (ſaith he) two Diviſions of the Land: the one in <hi>Gilgal,</hi> about the ſeventh or eighth year after the entrance thereinto: the other in <hi>Shiloh</hi> ſome years after. At the firſt, the Diviſion was but begun, not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: yea, for certaine cauſes put off, and to be accounted as if nothing had been done: From the latter therefore (in his judgement) the <hi>Sabbathical</hi> year ought to be reckoned.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Philip</hi> in Chonology</note> Adding moreover, and ſaying; <hi>Hebraei idem ſentiunt, qui Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata terrae à decimo quarto anno ab ingreſſu computant.</hi> Hereunto agree ſundry others; as <hi>Maſius, Magalianus, Menochius,</hi> and <hi>Wolphius</hi> in his firſt book <hi>De Tempore,</hi>

                     <p>All this I know, and finde to be the opinions of <hi>Scaliger, Bucholcerus, Calviſius, Alſtedius, Armachanus,</hi> &amp; of thoſe other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors aforeſaid. Howbeit, becauſe the Jubilees doe afford the beſtharmony, if they begin when the Jews were ready to paſſe over <hi>Iordan</hi> into the promiſed Land, and end when they were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115738:23"/>ready to be caſt out, I hold me to what I mentioned firſt. For though they who ſtrive for the fourteenth year of <hi>Joſhua</hi> have ſaid enought to remove the head of this reckoning from the ſeventh of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in regard that the Land was not fully conquered then, nor the Tribes ſent home till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: yet is not their argument ſtrong enough to ſix it in the time they ſtrive for. For if the obſervation of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count had been deferred ſo long, it had been an argument of great neglect, eſpecially in them who had their Parts or Portions long before. The two tribes and the halfe had their inheritance at the very firſt on the other ſide of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, before the other paſſed over <hi>Jordan;</hi> and there they left their Cattell, Wives, and Children: which happened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the laſt year of <hi>Moſes</hi> already mentioned. After which, by ſuch time as they were gone over, they had no more Manna, but lived on the annuall fruits of the Land, and did rather (as day by day they came into their hands) husband in common the Fields, Vineyards, and Olive-yards, then ſpoyle and waſt them. And as they husbanded them in common, ſo by virtue of that Law which belonged to them all, they all of them (as well on the one ſide of the river as the other) let the Land reſt by a joynt conſent, in the ſeventh year after they, or any of them, began to poſſeſſe any part of it: and had at that Reſt as much particularly divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome other of the Tribes, as was then conquered: the reſt of the Land being as well undivided as fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered untill the ſeventh year after, which was the ſecond ſeven, and thirteenth (not fourteenth) year of <hi>Joſhua.</hi>

                     <p>IN the year of the Julian Period 710. the Creation began;
<note place="margin">The Creation</note> as by the former Periods appeareth: The preciſe time of which beginning ſeemeth to be at the evening of the twenty three day of <hi>Aprill.</hi> For by the primitive practiſe of Gods owne example, the day was from evening to evening; and was ſo commanded alſo afterward by a written Law, in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.32. To ſpeak therefore of the divine inſtitution of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dayes, we are to ſay that the evening as well as the morning, is pertinent to one and the ſame day, but make not up the whole day: for the whole day naturally, is that which we call in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and is a day of day and night together. And therefore in that phraſe of <hi>Moſes [the Evening and the Morning were the firſt Day]</hi> is a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> by which the beginning of the night and of the day, is put for the whole night and day; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> by that before pointed at in <hi>Leviticus</hi> may be ſeen: for there the day is reckoned from even to even, as being that which (if we reſpect the progreſſe of the Worlds Creation) naturally and indeed is a true day, although the artificiall day be but from the Sun-riſing to the ſetting thereof.</p>
                     <p>This being premiſed, I take the beginning of the Creation to be, according to the Julian account, on the twenty three
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115738:25"/>day of <hi>Aprill</hi> at evening: ſo that the firſt day of the World was not ended till the evening of the twenty fourth day. The ſecond day was after the ſame manner <hi>Aprill</hi> the twenty five. The third, <hi>Aprill</hi> the twenty ſix. The fourth, <hi>Aprill</hi> the twenty ſeventh: On which day the Sun, Moon and Stars were made, and ſet in the firmament of Heaven: The Sun pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in that part thereof which we now call the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Aries.</hi> The fifth day was <hi>Aprill</hi> the twenty eight. The ſixth, <hi>Aprill</hi> the twenty nine: that being the very day when the Sun and Moon were firſt of all in Conjunction: which was therefore the firſt day of the moneth, and might well by <hi>Adam</hi> be accounted ſo, becauſe it was alſo the very firſt day that ever he ſaw.
<note place="margin">Of <hi>Adam</hi> and his fall.</note> Now that on this Day <hi>Adam</hi> ſell, divers of the Learned (both Jews and Chriſtians) think: but it is a Tenet ſcarcely probable, not onely in regard of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and variety of things don on the day that he was made, both before and after his Creation; but alſo becauſe this ſixth day concluded by <hi>Moſes</hi> with theſe words: And God beheld all that he had made, and loe it was exceeding good: <hi>So the Evening and the Morning were the ſixth day,</hi> Gen. 1.31. More like it is that <hi>Adam</hi> fell on the twelf day of <hi>May</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 3.8.</note> Evening, when the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth was ending, and the fifteenth (which was on the ſixth day of the week) ready to begin: which time and day agree very well to the inſtitution of the firſt Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the eating of the laſt Paſſeover and crucifying of Chriſt on the ſixth day of the Week, and fifteenth day of the moneth: For on that day Chriſt dyed, even as on that day (4037. years before) Chriſt was promiſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> who had fallen as it were the day before, towards evening; as already hath been ſaid. In this year the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Sun was ten, the Dominicall letter B. the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Moon ſeven, the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox at evening on the twenty three day of <hi>Aprill</hi> when the creation began, and the New Moon (or firſt day of the firſt moneth) on the nine and twenty day of <hi>Aprill feria ſexta,</hi> which was the ſixth day of the Week as hath been ſaid, and is exactly true according to Calculation.</p>

                     <p>Alſo, to the year of the Julian Period 2366.
<note place="margin">The Flood.</note> when the Flood came, the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Sun was 14. the Dominicall letter D. and the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Moon ten: The <hi>Vernall Equinox</hi> was on the tenth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> and the Autumnall on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>October.</hi> By which is gathered that the firſt day of the firſt moneth, in this year of the Flood was on the twenty one day of <hi>Aprill, feria tertia:</hi> the beginning of every moneth ordinarily being according to the <hi>Phaſis</hi> or firſt viſion of the Moon, which in the Land of Iſrael (and the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about) might for the moſt part be by eleven hours and thirty minutes after the time of the mean Conjunction.</p>
                     <p>And at no time could ſhe be hid longer then 28. hours and 30. minu. as the learned Jews have told us. Now the firſt day on the firſt Moneth being on the 21 day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> ſheweth that the 17. day of the ſecond Moneth when the Flood began, was on the fifth of <hi>June feria ſexta,</hi> even on the ſame day of the weeke on which the Beaſts and Man was made. So that as on the ſixth day of the week both Man and Beaſt were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in like manner on the very ſame day of week the Flood began by which they were deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Know alſo that this firſt Moneth, or the firſt Moneth of this yeere, had but 29. dayes. The Second, third, fourth, fifth and ſixth had 30 dayes a peice. The ſeventh 28. the laſt of which was on the 13 day of <hi>October.</hi> The eighth had 30. The ninth 29. The tenth 30. The eleventh 29. And the twelfth 30. the laſt of which was on the tenth day of <hi>Aprill</hi> in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2367. So that the 27 day of the ſecond Moneth in the ſaid yeare, was on the ſame day that the Flood began in the yeare before; even on the fifth of <hi>June,</hi> which now was Sabbath day, on the which <hi>Noah</hi> came out of the Arke and offered Sacrifice, at the very time of a full year of dayes after the Flood began, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.14.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of which reckoning thus, is this: namely,
<note place="margin">Note this; it is no meane Character of a right time.</note> That though the Ancients even in the times of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> uſed to begin their Moneth <hi>à prima</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or from the 1. ſight of the Moon; yet if the Moon could not be ſeen by reaſon of clouds, they then accounted 30 dayes for every ſuch Moneth, though to ſome of them there would have been but 29 if the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115738:26"/>firſt ſight of the Moon had been hindred.</p>
                     <p>Now in ſuch a wet cloudie time as we may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be when the Flood came, the Moon muſt needs be obſcured and hid for many dayes; not only the 40 dayes and nights when it rained continually, but even to the end of the CL. on which if ſome raine had not fallen, but that the skie had been clear &amp; without clouds, there would in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have been an abatement of the waters before thoſe 150. dayes were ended: but no abatement was till then, if the words be taken as they Originally ſignifie in <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.3.</p>
                     <p>And now why the ſeventh Moneth here mentioned had but 28 dayes, is becauſe after the 150. dayes were ended, the Aire began to be cleare, inſomuch that <hi>Noah</hi> knew when to begin the next Moneth by ſight of the Moon: upon which I believe it was that <hi>Beroſus</hi> ſaid, <hi>Noah</hi> ordered the yeare to the courſe of the Sun, and the Moneth to the courſe of the Moon. For as <hi>Wolphius</hi> truly gathereth out of <hi>Gen.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wolph De Temp. lib. 1. pag. 21.</note> 8.22. <hi>Noah</hi> was not the firſt Author of the ancient yeare: but the yeare being ſomewhat interrupted by the Flood was by him brought backe to the old ancient forme, which he taught his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p>But now for the finding out of this eighth Moneth, <hi>Noah</hi> I ſay knew when to begin it by the firſt ſight of the Moon, which at <hi>Babylon</hi> and the parts thereabouts was on the 14. day of <hi>October</hi> in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2366, after which <hi>Noah</hi> was in the Arke untill the 27 day of the ſecond Moneth, and then came forth, even to the fifth day of <hi>June</hi> which was a Sabbath day and a juſt Solar year after the Flood began.</p>
                     <p>And note that the day on which the Arke reſted upon Mount <hi>Ararat</hi> was the ſecond day of <hi>November,</hi> in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2366. for that was the ſeventeenth day of the ſeventh Moneth, and the next after the laſt of CL. dayes that the Waters prevailed. For (I ſaid before) the waters prevailed 150. dayes, of which the 40 dayes of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all rain were part; elſe how could the Arke reſt on the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the ſeventh Moneth? we are ſure enough it did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.4.</p>

                     <p>Not ſo. The tops of the Mountaines; but not the tops of the higheſt Mountaines. For the Mountaine tops appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on the firſt day of the tenth Moneth, were rather the tops of the Iower and inferiour Hils, then of the higheſt Mountaines. And for the ark reſting on the <hi>Ararat</hi> two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths before; to that I anſwer: namely thus. The Arke was a vaſt body; and being ſo vaſt a body as it was, it could not chuſe but draw many Cubits of water. Now ſuppoſe this proportion to be XI Cubits (and ſo many it might well be;) And if XI. then will it follow that the bottome of the Ark could never be more then foure Cubits from the tops of of the higheſt hils: and in one day (and leſſe) thoſe 4 Cubits (and more) might eaſily be abated. Nor may this ſeeme ſtrange: for though the depth from the tops of the higheſt Hils, to the ſuperficies of the Iower grounds, were as great as 30 furlongs (of which height they ſay Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> is;) yet by confidering in what time that ſpace was dryed up, and drawing the abatement into a proportion, it will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare that even to the firſt day may be allowed more by farre then foure Cubits. See Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and there you ſhall find, That ſome who have proportioned the full time of abatement (which was from the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the ſeventh Moneth, to the firſt day of the firſt Moneth) with the ſpace from the height to the higheſt Mountaines, have allowed 37. Cubits and an halfe for every day. But Igrant not every dayes abatement to be alike, becauſe the greateſt compaſſe above muſt have the leſſer abatement; yet nevertheleſſe the firſt day might well have ſo much as would ſuffer the Arke to reſt ſo ſoone as it did on the high Mountaines of <hi>Ararat:</hi> upon which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith it reſted on the ſeventeenth day of the ſeventh Moneth, CL. dayes after
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115738:27"/>the beginning of the Flood. What more concerns the Flood ſhall be handled afterward.</p>

                        <hi>Terah</hi> dyed in the year of the Julian Period 2794,
<note place="margin">The Promiſe.</note> and (as may be conjectured) not many dayes before the Promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who hereupon departed out of <hi>Haran,</hi> from his Kindred and his Fathers houſe, when he had almoſt finiſhed the ſeventy fifth of his age, even in the year of the World 2085. Now in this year the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Sun was twenty two, the Dominicall letter A. the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Moon one, and the Vernall Equinox <hi>Aprill</hi> the ſeventh. By which is gathered that the firſt day of the firſt moneth, called after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Niſan,</hi> was one the 31. day of <hi>March, feria ſexta.</hi> The next moneth began <hi>Aprill</hi> the twenty nine, <hi>feria ſeptima:</hi> The Promiſe might be then. After which <hi>Abraham</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of <hi>Haran</hi> on the third or fourth of <hi>May,</hi> when the Sun was in the twenty ſix or twenty ſeventh degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> in which place it was 430. years after on the twenty nine or thirtieth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> when <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as you ſhall ſee by and by in that which I am to mention next.</p>
                     <p>For in the next place the time of the comming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> is to be conſidered.
<note place="margin">The Exodus or comming out of <hi>Egypt</hi>
                        </note> This was in the year of the Julian Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od 3224. and in the year of the World 2515. In this year the Equinox was on the third day of <hi>Aprill, feria ſeptima:</hi> The <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Sun was four, the Dominicall letter C. and the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Moon thirteen. By which is gathered that the firſt day of <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Niſan</hi> was on the ſixteenth day of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill, feria ſexta:</hi> the Iſraelites therefore killed and eat the Paſſeover on the twenty ninth day of <hi>April,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the moneth, <hi>feria quinta.</hi> After midnight they are driven out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſent away in haſte: and therefore their comming from thence is to be reckoned on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> which was the ſixth day of the Week; even as on the ſame day of the Week Chriſt purchaſed a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Redemption by the blood of the Croſſe. In all which I doe much admire at the wonderfull Providence of God, in diſpoſing of the times ſo exactly and harmoniouſly: For as on the ſixth day of the Week Man was made, and Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115738:27"/>So on the ſixth day of the weeke <hi>Iſrael</hi> was delivered out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, on the very next day after the Paſſeover, even as on the next day after the Paſſeover Chriſt our Paſſeover was ſacrificed for us,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7.</note> to free us from the bon dage of Sinne and Sathan. In this year at this time, the Sunne was in the 27. degree of <hi>Aries: Abraham</hi> therefore by an exact account (having received the promiſe) went out of <hi>Haran</hi> on the fourth day of <hi>May</hi> 430. yeares before, when the Sunne was alſo in the ſame point of Heaven that he was in now. And why on the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> rather then on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> was in regard of the anticipation of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall; which, if we will reckon preciſely, is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe (as hath been ſhewed) the <hi>Julian</hi> yeare agreeth not exactly to the courſe of the Sunne. But to go on: The Hiſtory of the
<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 16.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Manna</hi> doth alſo well accord to this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the day of the comming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould be on the fixth day of the weeke: and in that is another ſparke of Gods Providence; witneſſe the fifteenth day of the ſecond Moneth,
<note place="margin">Another Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a right time.</note> which by accounting nine and twenty dayes to the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, fell into the ſeventh day of the weeke on which the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> murmured, had <hi>Quailes</hi> at even, and on the morrow morning <hi>Manna;</hi> which they gathered ſix dayes, but on the ſeventh day they found none, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.26. By which we ſee not onely the two and twentieth day of the ſecond mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth was Sabbath day, but alſo that the firſt <hi>Manna</hi> fell on the firſt day of the Week, now called the Lords day in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our Saviours Reſurrection, and hath been the Chriſtians Sabbath ever ſince: and for the firſt moneth to have but 29 dayes,
<note place="margin">Let this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred: for it is a Rule to me in all the moneths in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year.</note> is more conſentaneous to the motion of the Moon, then to have 30 before the odd houres ariſe to a day, which is not till the ſecond moneth: The firſt moneth therefore hath but 29 dayes, though the ſecond hath 30. For in one moneth (according to the meane motion of the Moon, from one Conjunction to another) we have but 29 dayes, 12 houres, 44 minutes, three ſeconds, and 12 thirds. I account therefore that the Iſraelites came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> when the nine and twentieth day of <hi>April</hi> was ending, and the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115738:28"/>beginning. I account likewiſe that the firſt <hi>Manna</hi> fell on the thirtieth day of <hi>May, feria prima:</hi> and conſequently that the nine and twentieth day of <hi>May</hi> and fifth of <hi>June</hi> were Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes; the one on the fifteenth day of the ſecond mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and the other on the two and twentieth.</p>
                     <p>That which I ſhall mention next is the year of the Julian Period 3703.
<note place="margin">The Temple founding.</note> and year of the World 2994. in which year King <hi>Salomon</hi> laid the foundation of the Temple on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of the ſecond moneth. The <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Sun was ſeven, the Dominicall letter F. the Vernall Equinox upon the one and thirty day of <hi>March,</hi> and the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Moon ſeventeen. By which is gathered that the firſt day of <hi>Niſan</hi> was on the laſt day of <hi>March, feria prima:</hi> and conſequently that King <hi>Salomon</hi> began to build the Temple on the laſt day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> which was the ſecond day of the ſecond moneth, <hi>feria tertia:</hi> for on the ſecond day of the ſecond moneth this great work was begun, as may be ſeen in 2 <hi>Chronicles</hi> 3.2. This was the fourth year of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> and after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> the 480. not compleate but current. For indeed there were but 479. years fully finiſhed, which with reſpect had to the place of the Sun at both times, and the anticipation of the Equinoctiall from the comming of <hi>Egypt</hi> to this time of the Temple, doth ſhew the end of their reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning to be on the twenty ſix or twenty ſeventh day of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill,</hi> three or four dayes and no more before the Temple was founded. Thus then from the comming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to the beginning of the building of the Temple were 479. years and about four dayes: it was founded therefore in the 480. year after the comming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as is mentioned in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.1.</p>
                     <p>The next that I ſhall mention is the year of the Julian Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion 3710.
<note place="margin">The Temple dedicated.</note> It was the eleventh year of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> and year when the Temple was dedicated, 1 <hi>Kings c.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 38. and Chap. 8.2.

                     <p>This ſeventh Month being ended there was nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Temple for the quite compleating of it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is (as <hi>Codoman</hi> noteth) that in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.38. the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is ſaid to be finiſhed in the eighth Moneth, in the eleventh year of King <hi>Salomon:</hi> That is, It was then finiſhed in all the parts thereof, and according to all the faſhion and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of it both within and without. Or as the marginall reading in our laſt tranſlation expreſſeth, It was then finiſhed with all the appurtenances, and with all the Ordinances ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Which is as <hi>Bucholcerus</hi> obſerveth. It was dedicated (ſaith he) in the Moneth <hi>Ethanim;</hi> and in the following Moneth <hi>Bul</hi> it was finiſhed with all the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>All which conſidered, we ſhall not need to drive the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the twelfth yeare of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> as ſome have done: for if it were not dedicated till then, it muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow that it lay void for a whole year together after it was finiſhed, which is very unlike.</p>
                     <p>Beſide, that this was the right year of the dedication, I can further demonſtrate by the courſes of the Prieſts which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Temple till <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> deſtroyed it: for we may eaſily beleeve that in the firſt Sabbath of the dedication, the courſe of <hi>Joarib</hi> began, which we here ſee to be on the ſeventeenth day of <hi>October.</hi> To which time if we add 224. <hi>Julian</hi> yeares (in which ſpace the courſes returne to the ſame day againe) we ſhall come to the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3934. on the ſeventeenth day of <hi>October.</hi> After which we have 192. years more before we can come to the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4126. in which the Temple was deſtroyed; noting theſe 192. yeares to end on the ſeventeeenth day of <hi>October</hi> likewiſe. And in 192. yeares we find 417. courſes with 72. dayes over and above: which 72 dayes being taken out of the number of dayes which were from the beginning of that year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> to the ſaid ſeventeenth day of <hi>October,</hi> do direct us to the ſixth day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> which then was Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day and the courſe of <hi>Joarib:</hi> even that courſe of his in which the Temple was deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>For when the Temple was deſtroyed it was the watch and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115738:29"/>courſe of <hi>Joarib,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> have told us in their <hi>Seder Olam rabba:</hi> the courſe I ſay of <hi>Joarib:</hi> and IX. of <hi>Ab;</hi> which day is noted by them to be the next after the Sabbath, and the next after the Weekes end, as Maſter <hi>Livelie</hi> expoundeth the Hebrew text of that teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>And thus having done with this,
<note place="margin">The Temple deſtroyed by <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar.</hi>
                        </note> I go on to the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4126, which was the nineteenth yeare of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> when the Temple and City were deſtroyed. The Cycle of the Sun was 10. the Dominicall letter B. the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Moon 3. and the Vernall Equinox on the 27 day of <hi>March. Calviſius</hi> I am ſure, and <hi>Scaliger</hi> as I remember, reckon this Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to be in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4124. But they faile of the true time. For in that yeare the firſt day of the firſt Moneth could not be any day later then the 27. day of <hi>March,</hi> and that was <hi>feria quinta:</hi> whereas if it be the true time, it ſhould be rather <hi>feria prima. Petavius</hi> is for the next yeare, <hi>viz.</hi> 4125. But in that year take either the Conjunction in <hi>March,</hi> or in <hi>Aprill,</hi> and neither will ſerve. For the one conjunction caſts the firſt of <hi>Niſan</hi> into the fifteenth of <hi>March, feria ſecunda;</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the thirteenth of <hi>Aprill, feria tertia:</hi> This therefore could not be the yeare neither, as appeareth by the day of the weeke before mentioned on which the IX. day of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> muſt be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Langius,</hi> in his booke <hi>De annis Chriſti,</hi> pitcheth upon the yeare of the <hi>Julian Peried</hi> 4117: but therein hath alſo failed of the true time; not only becauſe he is thereupon inforced to alter the reigne of <hi>Nabopollaſſar;</hi> but alſo becauſe the 40. yeares that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith <hi>Egypt</hi> was under <hi>Babel,</hi> will thereby be ended before their right time. For <hi>Egypt</hi> had not ſhaken off that yoke till after <hi>Cyrus</hi> had conquered <hi>Babylon,</hi> as is more then once recorded by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and approved therein by men of no meane learning, and particularly by <hi>Jacobus Armachanus</hi> in his Annals of holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>I do undoubtingly therefore conciude the right yeare to be the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4126. in which year the firſt of <hi>Niſan</hi> was on the third day of <hi>Aprill feria prima:</hi> and the IX. of <hi>Ab.</hi> on the ſeventh day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which was alſo <hi>feria
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115738:30"/>prima:</hi> at which time <hi>Joarib</hi> was in his courſe, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on it <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 6. <hi>feria Septima,</hi> for that the IX. of <hi>Ab</hi> was on the Eve of the Sabbath; I do not underſtand it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then of the Eve ending the Sabbath; at which time the Enemie entred into the Temple to deſtroy it; even in the Courſe of <hi>Joarib.</hi> And thereupon it is that the <hi>Jewes</hi> in mournfull manner (according to the inſtitution of their great <hi>Synedrion</hi>) uſe to ſing thus:
<q>
                           <l>Die nona menſis <hi>Ab,</hi> bora Veſpertini temporis,</l>
                           <l>Quum eſſem in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>igilia mea, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>igilia Joarib,</l>
                           <l>Introiit hostis, &amp; Sacrificia ſua obtulit,</l>
                           <l>Ingreſſus eſt in Sanctuarium injuſſu Dei.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus they, as their words ſound in the Latine. But in this we are to note, that albeit the enemy entred into the Temple to deſtroy it on the ninth of <hi>Ab</hi> and courſe of <hi>Joarib,</hi> yet the ſaid Temple was not burnt untill the next day: for it was on the tenth day of the fifth moneth; as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſheweth, in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 52.12. And note alſo that on ſome part of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the fire was kindled ſooner, even three dayes before, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.8. burning from the ſeventh day untill the tenth. For ſo thoſe two texts (in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and the ſecond book of the <hi>Kings</hi>) may well enough be reconciled. And note laſt of all, that the City was broken up and <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> taken a full moneth before: <hi>viz.</hi> on the ninth day of the fourth moneth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.3. which (according to our Julian Kalender) was this year on the eighth day of <hi>Iuly, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria ſexta.</hi> So then, the City was broken up on the eigthh of <hi>Iuly;</hi> and the Temple burnt on the eighth of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as for that which <hi>Scaliger</hi> alledgeth out of that book of the Jews which they call <hi>Liber Angariarum,</hi> wherein is written that they faſt on the fifth day of the week, as if on that day of the week the Temple was burnt by the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans.</hi> To that I anſwer, that as in ſpeaking of the ninth of <hi>Ab,</hi> they doe one day antedate the account of the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> for the day of the moneth: ſo in like manner they doe here antedate one day of the week, and make that to be on the fifth day of the week, which by comparing their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115738:30"/>teſtimony with another Scriptures) appeareth to be on the 6th day of the Weeke. For if according to the <hi>Seder Olam,</hi> the ninth of <hi>Ab</hi> were on the firſt day of the week, then muſt the ſeventh of <hi>Ab</hi> be on the ſixth day of the week, and to be that day on which the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> began to ſet fire on ſome part of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> as already hath been ſhewed out of 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 25.8.</p>
                     <p>Moreover <hi>Sealiger</hi> and ſome others have ſuppoſed that this year of the deſtruction of the Temple by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> muſt be <hi>Sabbathicall</hi> from the Autumne before: and this they ſay the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> confirmeth, in the 28. chapter of his prophecy, at the firſt verſe: where he ſheweth that when <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechia</hi> began to reign, it was the fourth year; which they take to be the fourth year of a week from the Autumne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And if ſo, then will the fourth year of his reigne be <hi>Sabbathicall</hi> till the Autumne thereof: and if his fourth year, then his eleventh or laſt year in like manner. Nor was this (ſay they) but that year of Reſt which the ſame Prophet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the 34 chapter of his prophecy, where we read that when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had raiſed his ſeige from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to goe againſt the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Jewes took againe their Man-ſervants and Maide-ſervants, which they had a little before ſet at liberty, becauſe it was a <hi>Sabbathicall</hi> year, and would not let them goe free as the Law required in <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.12.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, that the clearing of this dependeth upon the reſolution of that doubt which concerneth that year in which the falſe Prophet <hi>Hananiah</hi> reſiſted <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and dyed becauſe he taught rebellion againſt the Lord, and perſwaded the people (contrary to the prophecy of <hi>Jeremiah</hi>) that <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> yoke muſt not be endured 70 years, but that within two full years it muſt be broken. Which ſtory is at large ſet downe in the 27 and 28 Chapters of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and by <hi>Scaliger</hi> referred to the firſt year of <hi>Zedechia,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuppoſeth it to be the fourth year after a year of Reſt: of which I ſee no reaſon, becauſe the whole ſcope of the four and thirtieth Chapter doth demonſtrate that year to be a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115738:31"/>year of Reſt when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> laid his ſeige againſt <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> which we know to be the ninth year of <hi>Zedechia,</hi> and tenth day of the tenth moneth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 52.4. Now this was in the year of the Julian Period 4124. on the ſeventh of <hi>Ianuary feria tertia;</hi> at which time the ninth of <hi>Zedechia</hi> was ſtill running on, and was not ended till about the beginning of the fourth moneth next after. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to beſeige <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> on the ſeventh day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> in the year of the Julian Period 4124. which year was Sabbathicall from the Autumne before till the Autumne thereof, and was that Sabbathicall year in which the Jews let their ſervants goe free in the beginning thereof, thereby encouraging them to fight againſt the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> who then were come into the confines of <hi>Iudea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ſer. 34.1.</note> and fought againg the Cities thereof, <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> not excepted, but had not yet laid their ſeige againſt it: for that was not untill the time before mentioned. How long this continued before the <hi>Egyptians</hi> came with an Army to ſuccour <hi>Zedechia,</hi> by raiſing this firſt ſeige, is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
<note place="margin">Jer. 37.5.</note> but that they came, and that the ſeige thereupon was raiſed, is certaine. This when the Jews perceived, and ſaw that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> were gone from them to fight againſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 37.10.</note> they took their freed ſervants againe into bondage, vainely perſwading themſelves that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> would come back no more, which proved farre otherwiſe. For <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> having put to flight the Army of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> returns againe to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and on the fourth day of <hi>May,</hi> in the year of the Julian Period 4125. renewes his ſeige againſt it,

When therefore we read in <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.1.2. that <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Army lay before <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the tenth year of <hi>Zedechia,</hi> and eighteenth year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> it is to be underſtood of his lying againſt it after this renewing of his ſeige, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115738:31"/>before the beginning of the fourth moneth: for about the end of the third moneth, or beginning of the fourth, was the beginning of <hi>Zedechia's</hi> eleventh year, and likewiſe of all the other years of his reigne; inſomuch that his ninth year began at the ſame time, in the year of the Julian Period 4123 and was Sabbathicall from the Autumne thereof, untill the Autumne next after. From whence I conclude that if any part of <hi>Zedchia's</hi> ninth year was Sabbathicall, then could to his firſt year be the fourth after a Reſt, but the ſixth. <hi>Hananiah</hi> therefore dyed in no other then the fourth year of <hi>Zedechia,</hi> having reſiſted the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Zedechia's</hi> reigne till then; as Iearned <hi>Iunius,</hi> in his Annotations upon the place, well obſerveth.</p>
                     <p>And as for the burning of the Temple, take this note fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Temple was burnt before the full end of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> ninteenth year. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 25.8. For though at that time <hi>Zedechia</hi> had reigned eleven years compleat, yet was not <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> ninteenth year fully finiſhed, in regard that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> began his reigne ſomething later in the year then <hi>Zedechia</hi> did: for <hi>Zedechia</hi> began about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fourth moneth, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> began not till after the ſeventh day of the fifth moneth at the ſooneſt, whoſe firſt year was in the end of <hi>Jehoiakims</hi> third year and beginning of his fourth, in the year of the Julian Period 4107. at the Summer time of that year: For in the Spring time of the year of the Julian Period 4104. towards the end of the ſecond moneth, <hi>Ioſiah</hi> was ſlain;

                           <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.1. Towards the end of the third the ſeige began: but not till the fourth was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred did God give <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi> into the hands of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar.</hi> 2 <hi>Chro</hi> 36.6.</note> after whom <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> reigned three moneths: Then, in the Summer time of the ſame year, <hi>Iehoaikim</hi> began; in the end of whoſe third year, and beginning of his fourth, was the firſt year of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> as comparing the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> to the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> may be ſeen: at which time his Father was alive, as <hi>Beroſus</hi> ſheweth.

                        </head>
                        <p>THat the Flood came in the year of the World 1656. is granted by almoſt al Chronologers: only ſome few have caſt it into the year 1657. which I alſo take to be the right yeer, and have ſo accounted it: And that for theſe reaſons.</p>
                        <p>Firſt becauſe it came not till <hi>Methuſelah</hi> was dead; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born in the year of the World 688. (as by the ages of the Patriarches well appeareth) and living 969. years, muſt needs be a live till the year of the World 1656. was ended: The Flood therefore came not till the year of the World 1657. It is but a fabulous fancy to ſay that this Patriarch was alive and taken into Paradiſe: for unleſſe his abode were with <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark, the Waters of the Flood could not but drowne him. But as his name in the Hebrew ſignifieth, He dyeth, and the Emiſſion or Dart (meaning the Flood) cometh.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Noah</hi> was born (as doth alſo well appear by the ages of the Patriarchs) in the year of the World 1057. and lived 950 years: he dyed not therefore till the year of the World 2007. was begun. Out of which take 350. (for ſo long <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith <hi>Noah</hi> lived after the Flood) and there will remaine 1657. for the year when the Flood began.</p>
                        <p>And thirdly, the Mathematicall calculations already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned agree well to that year.</p>
                        <p>But it is objected: If the Flood came not in the year of the World 1656. how then could it come in the ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth year of <hi>Noah;</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> (in <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11.) ſaith it did.</p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:115738:33"/>
                        <p>Well enough, For though the Six hundreth year of <hi>Noah</hi> was not ended till after that Moneth in which the Flood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; yet it might be ended within ſome ſhort time after. For though the years of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> (both when they begat their children, and alſo when they themſelves died) were full and compleat yeares: yet who can clearly prove that they were all born at one and the ſame time of the yeare. It is therefore to be obſerved that <hi>Moſes</hi> beginns not his account of their yeares from the punctuall day of their Nativity, but rather from the beginning of the naturall yeare neareſt and next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the day of their birth, as learned <hi>Langius</hi> noteth. <hi>Patet id.</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in Noacho. Anno namque quo diluvium finitum eſt ineun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, primo die primo menſis, ſtatim incipiti</hi> 601 <hi>Noachi, cum tamen mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime certum ſit Noachum iſto die aut tempore fuiſſe natum. Lang. l</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 253.</p>
                        <p>Reckon therefore thus: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Seth</hi> was borne to <hi>Adam</hi> when <hi>Adam</hi> was fully and compleatly 130. yeares old: that is in the yeare of the world 131. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. To which add 105. (theage of <hi>Seth</hi> when <hi>Enos</hi> was borne) and ſo will the birth of <hi>Enos</hi> be in the year of the world 236, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.6. To which add 90. (the age of <hi>Enos</hi> when <hi>Kenan</hi> was born) ſo ſhall the birth of <hi>Kenan</hi> be in the yeare of the world 326. <hi>Gen</hi> 5.9. To which add 70 (the age of <hi>Kenan</hi> when <hi>Mahalaleel</hi> was borne, ſo ſhall the birth of <hi>Mahalaleel</hi> be in the yeare of the World 396. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.12. To which add 65 the age of <hi>Mahalaleel</hi> when <hi>Jared</hi> was borne) ſo ſhall the birth of <hi>Jared</hi> be in the year of the world 461. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.15. To which add 162. (the age of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> when <hi>Henoch</hi> was born) ſo ſhalll the birth of <hi>Henoch</hi> be in the yeare of the World 623. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.18. To which add 65. (the age of <hi>Henoch</hi> when <hi>Methuſelah</hi> was born) ſo ſhall the birth of <hi>Methuſelah</hi> be in the yeare of the world 688. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.21. To which adde 187. (the age of <hi>Methuſelah</hi> when <hi>Lamech</hi> was born) ſo ſhall the birth of <hi>Lamech</hi> be in the yeare of the World 875. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.25. To which add 182. (the age of <hi>Lamech</hi> when <hi>Noah</hi> was borne) ſo ſhall the birth of <hi>Noah</hi> be in the year of the world 1057. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.29. To which add 600 years of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo ſhall the year of the world be 1657. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115738:33"/>whereof the ſix hundreth yeare of <hi>Noah</hi> was not quite fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as already hath been ſhewed. And thus we ſee the year of the Flood to be in the yeare of the World 1657, which ended not untill the year 1658. was begun.</p>
                        <p>And now for the time of the yeare when it began, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith that it was in the ſecond Moneth and ſeventeenth day of the Moneth when all the fountaines of the great Deepe and Windowes of Heaven were opened: which ſecond Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth muſt be reckoned from the Spring, and not from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne; as in the ſecond Chapter I have already proved. <hi>Bero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> the <hi>Chaldean</hi> agreeth thereunto, ſaying that the Flood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan on the fifteenth day of that Moneth, which with them was called by the name of <hi>Deſius,</hi> which Moneth <hi>Deſius</hi> is confeſſed by <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his Notes, <hi>page</hi> 44. to agree to that which <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth the ſecond Moneth: The leſſe reaſon therfore had <hi>Scaliger</hi> to decline it; only he might have held to this, that though the Moneth were right, yet the day was wrong; for if <hi>Deſius</hi> were alltogether the ſame with that which was the ſecond Moneth among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> then ſhould not the day mentioned be the fifteenth, but ſeventeenth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.10.</p>
                        <p>Or if the Moneth were not alltogether the ſame, but muſt have a fixed time of beginning, which <hi>Langius</hi> proveth to be on the 25 day of <hi>May;</hi> then muſt the Flood begin, not on the fifteenth day thereof, but on thr twelfth: which day of <hi>Deſius</hi> I take to be the firſt day of the Flood, in regard that in this year it agreeth both to the fifteenth day of the ſecond Moneth mentioned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as alſo to the fifth day of <hi>June</hi> when the Flood began.</p>
                        <p>But of this I ſhall need to ſay no more. That which is next, ſhall be an Hebrew and <hi>Iulian Kalender</hi> for the whole time of the Flood, accounting the beginning thereof to be in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2366. on the fifth day of <hi>June, feria ſexta.</hi>

                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.32.</note> 205. yeares; from whence if we take 75, it will appeare that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not borne when <hi>Terah</hi> was Seventie, as the text ſeemeth to intimate, but when he was 130. becauſe 75. taken out of 205, leaveth for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder 130.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is witneſſed by the ancient teſtimony of the true, not forged <hi>Philo,</hi> who being a <hi>Jew,</hi> was Ambaſſadour from his owne Nation to <hi>Caius Caligula;</hi> witneſſed I ſay by him, that <hi>Abraham</hi> went not from <hi>Haran</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Charran</hi>) untill his Father was dead. For it is not like (ſaith he) that any who have read the Law can be ignorant how <hi>Abraham</hi> removing from the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Land ſtayed in <hi>Charran:</hi> and when his Father dyed there, he removed alſo from that Land. And againe, He leaveth it being ſeventie five years old, which <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo ſaith in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.4.</p>
                        <p>This of <hi>Philo</hi> is a cleare teſtimony, and well worthy of our ſerious acceptation: for he was as ancient as the <hi>Protomar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr Stephen,</hi> and underſtands <hi>Moſes</hi> no other way then he had done.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Rabbi Menaſſeh</hi> (in his <hi>Conciliator</hi>) declareth the ſame; ſhewing there, that their beſt learned Interpreters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it ſo.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The age of <hi>Abraham</hi> bring expreſſed when he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115738:41"/>came from <hi>Charran,</hi> and not when he removed from <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r,</hi> was for no reaſon but to guid us to the time his of birth by being joyned to the time of <hi>Terah's</hi> death, who dyed in <hi>Charran</hi> and not in <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r, Gen.</hi> 11.32. And further note, that in <hi>Chaldea</hi> God appeares to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and bids him, Get thee out of thy Country and from thy kindred, but maketh no mention of leaving his Fathers houſe, for that he took along with him, <hi>Gens</hi> 11.31. But when God cals him from <hi>Haran</hi> or <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> he then bids him depart from his Father houſe as well as he had done from his Country and kindred before; for now he left his brother <hi>Nahor</hi> and all his Fathers houſe behinde him. In the firſt Call <hi>Terah</hi> was alive, &amp; to him is aſcribed the conduct of that Journey from <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> to the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> as if he had received the Call, and had been the chiefe mover in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but it is onely to ſhew his
<note n="*" place="margin">Ioſhua 24.2.</note> Converſion and readineſſe to goe with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom God appeared whilſt he was in <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees, Gen.</hi> 15.7. ſaying, Get thee out of thy Country, and from thy kindred, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.2.3. See alſo <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.2. But in the ſecond Call <hi>Terah</hi> was dead, and <hi>Abraham</hi> was 57 years old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.4. And as he was 57, ſo his Father was 205. which ſheweth ſtill that <hi>Abraham</hi> was borne when <hi>Terah</hi> was 130. For the ſtory in <hi>Geneſis</hi> runs cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and in a continuation, this being the order of the words: And the dayes of <hi>Terah</hi> were 205 years, and he dyed in <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;</hi> and God ſaid unto <hi>Ahraham,</hi> Get thee from thy Fathers houſe: and in thee all the Nations of the Earth ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and <hi>Abraham</hi> was 75 years old when he departed from <hi>Charran.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To illuſtrate then the whole by way of paraphraſe: God in <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> and ſaid unto him, Get thee out from thy kindred, but take thy Fathers houſe with thee, and goe to to a Land which I ſhall ſhew thee: And when <hi>Abraham</hi> told <hi>Terah</hi> of his command, <hi>Terah</hi> condeſcended and conſented; And <hi>Terah</hi> took <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Sarai,</hi> and they went away together from <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and dwelt there. And <hi>Terah</hi> dyed in <hi>Haran;</hi> And then God ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Get thee out of thy Country and from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115738:41"/>thy kindered, and from thy Fathers houſe alſo now, and goe into the Land that I ſhall ſhew thee: that is, into <hi>Canaan;</hi> whether <hi>Abraham</hi> went ſo ſoon as he departed from <hi>Charran,</hi> which was in the Land of <hi>Chaldea</hi> alſo, and not far from <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r;</hi> wherefore God againe called <hi>Abraham</hi> thence to goe into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, Gen.</hi> 12.1. And although there was a nearer way from <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> than to goe By <hi>Charran</hi> (as in the Maps of thoſe Countries may be ſeen) yet becauſe the neareſt way was moſt dangerous and troubleſome, God led them about by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited and ſafe way, providing ſo for their infirmities, as he did the like afterwards for <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, <hi>Exodus</hi> 13.11.18.</p>
                        <p>Beſide, when <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaith:
<note place="margin">Ioſhua 24.2.</note> Our fathers beyond the River worſhipped ſtrange Gods, even <hi>Terah</hi> the Father of <hi>Abraham:</hi> he maketh <hi>Moſes</hi> more clear and manifeſt; <hi>viz.</hi> that to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> God appeared, by whom <hi>Terah</hi> was moved to goe with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now <hi>Moſes</hi> mentioneth onely the appearing to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the bringing of him out of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r;</hi> but leaveth the ſpeech to be gathered by the like in <hi>Geneſis</hi> the twelfe, from whence Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> frameth it; ſaying, that after <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah's</hi> death, God biddeth him leave his Fathers houſe, and not his Land and kindred onely. And note that the family of <hi>Terah</hi> was in his houſe: out of which <hi>Abraham</hi> could not depart while <hi>Terah</hi> is with him, as principall of the journey. Nor doth the Hebrew text in <hi>Geneſis, Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. but run on in plainneſſe, thus: <hi>And God ſaid unto Abraham.</hi> Not, <hi>for God had ſaid.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Terah</hi> dyed in <hi>Haran,</hi> God ſaid unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Get thee out of thy Country and from thy kindred, and from thy Fathers houſe, unto the Land that I will ſhew thee. And in a word, to take away all further ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill about theſe two callings of <hi>Abraham,</hi> let it be againe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that he was in his Country whilſt he was at <hi>Haran</hi> as well as when he was at <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees:</hi> for both theſe places were in one Country, in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the

<note place="margin">Note this, that as it was in the birth of <hi>Noahs</hi> Sons: ſo alſo in the birth of <hi>Thares</hi> Sons.</note>

                        <p>But to goe and give truth the more perfect luſtre, let this be likwiſe known &amp; wel obſerved, that <hi>Thare</hi> (or <hi>Terah</hi>) being 70 years old begat the eldeſt of thoſe three Sons (<hi>Abram, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor,</hi> and <hi>Haran</hi>) and not all of them: even as <hi>Noah</hi> had done before, who begat the eldeſt of his three [<hi>Sem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>] when he was 500. The eldeſt of them I ſay, and not any of them before that year: So that if <hi>Noah</hi> begat the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his three, when he was 500. then <hi>Terah</hi> begat the eldeſt of his three when he was 70. The eldeſt of <hi>Noah's</hi> three, was not <hi>Sem:</hi> neither could the eldeſt of <hi>Terah's</hi> three, be <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> becauſe the manner of ſpeaking is uſed in the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the one, which is in the Genealogies of the other. If therefore it could be proved that <hi>Sem</hi> were the eldeſt of <hi>Noah's</hi> children, it would be the more eaſily granted that <hi>Abraham</hi> was the eldeſt of <hi>Terah's</hi> children: but the one cannot be proved, and therefore the other may not be granted. The contrary may be found and made apparent, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Sem</hi> was not the eldeſt, nor that any of the three was borne before <hi>Noah</hi> was 500. which being ſo, the like muſt be in the begetting of <hi>Terah's</hi> Sons; namely, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was not the eldeſt (though firſt named) nor that any of the three was borne before <hi>Terah</hi> was 70. The nameing of <hi>Sem</hi> firſt, and of <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt, doth nothing prove their Elderſhip: For it is no neceſſary conſequence to ſay the firſt named in Scripture were alwayes the eldeſt in blood and birth; then ſhould <hi>Iacob</hi> be elder then <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> elder then <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes:</hi> which we know to be otherwiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.5. and <hi>chap.</hi> 48.20. It is therefore well obſerved that <hi>Moſes</hi> doth neither reckon the Sons of <hi>Terah,</hi> nor thoſe of <hi>Noah,</hi> according to their Elderſhip, but according to their Dignity: and although they who be firſt named, had not the priority of Birthright; yet the Dignity of it is beſtowed on them, as it was upon <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and others: becauſe the Scriptures honour the bleſſed ſeed and line of Chriſt above the reſt. For in Scripture there is a three-fold order of numbring men: the firſt is Naturall; the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115738:42"/>ſecond Perſonall, or of Dignity; and the third Hiſtoricall. Now hereupon it was that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid: Piety (ſaith he) or rather divine Election, which evermore doth carry piety and the feare of God along with it, was the thing which gave place and precedency to <hi>Sem</hi> among the children of <hi>Noah,</hi> and to <hi>Abraham</hi> among thoſe of <hi>Terah.</hi> And indeed <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father of the faithfull, in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, was in that reſpect preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his other brethren. When therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> comes at <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> he then ends his Genealogie, and reckons three together, as he did before when he came at <hi>Noah;</hi> onely ſetting downe the time when either of them begat the eldeſt of the three: And leſt it might be thought that the firſt named was the firſt born, he doth ſhew that to be otherwiſe; as in <hi>Sem</hi> when he begat <hi>Arphaxad</hi> two years after the Flood, for then was <hi>Sem</hi> but an hundred years old; and in <hi>Abraham</hi> when his Father dyed, for then was <hi>Abraham</hi> but 75 years old. The elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among <hi>Noah's</hi> three belonged to <hi>Iapeth,</hi> but the dignity and prerogative belonged to <hi>Sem.</hi> For this is certaine: The Flood began in the 600 year of <hi>Noab's</hi> life; and <hi>Sem</hi> two years after that was but an hundred yeares old, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 11.10. Which being ſo, two muſt be added to 600. and then taking <hi>Sems</hi> 100 out of 602. the remainder will not be 500, but 502, which was the true and right age of <hi>Noah</hi> at <hi>Sems</hi> birth. The 500 year therefore is aſſigned for the birth of his eldeſt, which <hi>Moſes</hi> more expreſly ſaith was not <hi>Sem</hi> but <hi>Japhet;</hi> calling <hi>Sem</hi> the Father of the Sons of <hi>Heber,</hi> and brother of <hi>Iapeth</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Not the elder brother of <hi>Iapeth;</hi> as may be ſeen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.21. And of <hi>Cham</hi> (or <hi>Ham</hi>) he likewiſe ſaith, that he was a younger Son: For when <hi>Noah</hi> awoke from his wine, he knew what <hi>Cham</hi> his yonger Son had done, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.24, In which place the word <hi>younger</hi> hath relation to the other two Sons who were free from the fact: and therefore this <hi>Cham</hi> was the youngeſt of them all; for (as we ſee) it was in reſpect of his other brethren that he is called the younger ſon. And note that this alſo ſheweth, that till <hi>Noah</hi> was 500, none of all the three was born. Norwil the true reading of the text ſuffer it to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115738:43"/>be otherwiſe: For thus ſtand the Words. <hi>And</hi> Noah <hi>was</hi> 500 <hi>years old:</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> begat <hi>Sem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Iapeth.</hi> By which it appeareth, that unleſſe he had lived no longer then 500 years, not any of them all could be born before that time. Draw then the Parallel, and the like will be in the children of <hi>Terah</hi> which was in thoſe of <hi>Noah; viz.</hi> that the eldeſt of the three was born when their Father was 70, and this (as far as I can ſee any probability in the matter) muſt needs be <hi>Haran,</hi> who dyed before <hi>Terah,</hi> and had children marriageable for his two brethren; namely <hi>Milcha</hi> for <hi>Nahor,</hi> and <hi>Iſcha</hi> (if ſhe were <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rai</hi>) for <hi>Abraham.</hi> But however, whether ſhe were <hi>Sarai,</hi> yea or no, it makes no matter: for this is certaine, <hi>Lot</hi> was the Son of <hi>Haran,</hi> and not much younger then <hi>Abraham.</hi> For at the deſtruction of <hi>Sodome</hi> (<hi>Abraham</hi> being then
<note n="*" place="margin">At which time <hi>Abrahams</hi> body was ſaid to be dead, but was revived by the power of God, not onely for the generation of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but for further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation; as appeareth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.</note> 99 years old) when the daughters of <hi>Lot</hi> lay with their Father, they ſaid of him that he was an old man. Set then the birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> before <hi>Harans,</hi> and how can any of theſe things be?</p>
                        <p>Beſide, the time from the Flood to <hi>Terah's</hi> ſeventieth year was too ſhort to have the world ſo full of People and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes as it was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time:
<note place="margin">Hiſt. of the World, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>page</hi> 190.</note> For in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and long before (as it is excellently obſerved by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>) all the then known parts of the World were peopled: All regions and countries had their Kings. <hi>Egypt</hi> had many mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Cities: and ſo alſo had <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and all the bordring Countries; yea and all that part of the World beſide, as farre as <hi>India:</hi> And thoſe not built with ſticks, but of hewen ſtones, and defended with wals and Rampires: Which mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence needed a Parent of more Antiquity then they have ſuppoſed, who place the birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo near the Flood as <hi>Terah's</hi> ſeventieth year. For that time, even in reaſon, is not ſufficient, being
<note n="*" place="margin">It was no more then 292</note> leſſe then 300 years.</p>
                        <p>All therefore conſidered doe make me conclude that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> undoubtedly, was borne when <hi>Terah</hi> was 130 years old. For though ſome frivilous objections may be made to the contrary, yet it is in vaine to object againſt ſuch teſtimonies and proofes as will paſſe for current any where but among the Singular and inconſiderate, who are rather willing to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115738:43"/>wrangle for the upholding of their opinions, then to yeeld or give over from what they firſt tooke up to be true. For as there be ſome who love to keep to that which beſt fits their fancy: ſo there be others who think it a diſcredit to let goe what they at firſt maintained.</p>

                        <p>THis is proved by texts and teſtimonies out of Scripture. For firſt Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith expreſly, That the Law began
<note n="*" place="margin">There were ſome odd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths more. But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the moneths as an imperfect number.</note> 430 years after the Promiſe, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.17. Which that it was the ſame promiſe of Chriſt that <hi>Abraham</hi> had in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. is manifeſt by what the ſame Apoſtle ſaid before, at the eighth verſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That in thee ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be ſed: agreeing therein to <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 12.3.</p>
                        <p>Now this directeth to the right reckoning, but is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo preciſe as that which we have in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.40. For there we may perceive that the preciſe and exact ending of theſe years was not on the day that the Law was given, but on the day that the Iſraelites came away out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The words of which Text be theſe; And the ſojourning of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereby they ſojourned in <hi>Egypt</hi> 30 years, and 400 years. which ſpeech is altogether <hi>Elliptica oratio,</hi> or a defectve ſpeech: and is thus to be ſupplyed; namely, And the ſojourning of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whereby they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was to the end of 430 years. Not that they were in <hi>Egypt</hi> ſo long, but that they were a ſojourning Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo long: the beginning whereof was in the dayes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> at the time when he received the Promiſe, as by that of the Apoſtle before mentioned may be ſeen. The word <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing</hi> therefore (here uſed by <hi>Moſes</hi>) hath relation to that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115738:44"/>time of the Promiſe when <hi>Abraham</hi> left his Fathers houſe and became a ſojourner in a ſtrange Land, even the Land which God had promiſed to ſhew him, and which he afterwards gave to him to be poſſeſſed by his poſterity in the fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration after him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16.</p>
                        <p>And now that theſe years are preciſely and exactly ſo many and no more, appeareth by what followeth in the next verſe, <hi>viz. Exod.</hi> 12.41. wherein it is ſaid, That when the 430 years were finiſhed, even on the ſame day, all the hoſts of the Lord went out from the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They therefore that begin this reckoning at <hi>Jacobs</hi> going thither are deceived. For firſt <hi>Koath</hi> was one who went when <hi>Jacob</hi> went, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.11. His ſon was <hi>Amram, Exod.</hi> 6.18.20. and <hi>Amrams</hi> ſon was <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> 26.59. Wherefore ſeeing <hi>Koath</hi> was the enterer, and <hi>Moſes</hi> the departer, the time from thence could not extend to 430 yeares; for <hi>Koath</hi> lived but 133 years, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Amram</hi> but 137, verſ. 20. and <hi>Moſes</hi> was but 80 at the departure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 77. All which added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make but 350. and yet ſome of thoſe years muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, becauſe they were not born one at the juſt end of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life, but lived ſome while the father and the ſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which deduction being made, the years remaining will be yet fewer and want ſtill more of 430.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Jochabed</hi> was the mother of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate daughter of <hi>Levi,</hi> born to him in <hi>Egypt;</hi> as it is, <hi>Num.</hi> 26.59. Take then for a tryall the age of <hi>Moſes</hi> at the departure, which was
<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 7.7.</note> 80 years; and the whole age of <hi>Levi</hi> was
<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 6.16.</note> 137. years: and add them together, ſo ſhall you have 217. Unto which number muſt be added 213 for the age of <hi>Jochabed,</hi> or elſe there cannot be 430. But that this ſhould thus hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is impoſſible: for <hi>Levi</hi> was born 43 years before he came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and living but 137 in all, there can be but 94 taken from him, and but 80 from <hi>Moſes;</hi> which added together make but 174. Now then ſuppoſing that the abode in <hi>Egypt,</hi> from <hi>Jacobs</hi> going thither, was fully 430 years, it muſt needs be that <hi>Jochabed</hi> lived 256 years, although her age be accounted but from the day of her fathers death unto the day of her ſons
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115738:44"/>birth: But to ſay there is likelyhood in this, were extreme madneſſe. For who thinks it probable that a woman (in thoſe dayes) could be 256 years, and yet bear a childe? or that a Kings daughter would make choyce of one ſo old to be her Nurſe? Beſide, this womans age muſt be yet longer: for it is not like that ſhe was born juſt at her fathers death, neither is it true that ſhe dyed at her ſons birth, becauſe ſhe was choſen (by <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> daughter) to be his Nurſe.</p>
                        <p>And as for <hi>Levi,</hi> to prove that he was 43 years old (as hath been mentioned) this is well known; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was but four years younger then he, and when <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren came into <hi>Egypt, Ioſeph</hi> then was but 39 years old: <hi>Levi</hi> therefore muſt needs be 43 at the ſame time (becauſe four and 39 make 43) and not live his whole time after the deſcending of <hi>Iacob</hi> thither. Se <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.46. and compare it with <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.6.</p>
                        <p>Thus we ſee how <hi>Moſes</hi> is to be underſtood in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.40. and conſequently to account the 430. years of this <hi>Period.</hi> For the dwelling of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who dwelled in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was 430. yeares: that is, Their peregrination, or their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as ſtrangers. And ſo the Greeke tranſlateth; which the Apoſtle alſo confirmeth, in <hi>Act.</hi> 13.17. Their dwelling (I ſay) as ſtrangers, begun from the time that <hi>Abraham</hi> left his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and his Fathers houſe, as already hath been proved. For though this people were not called <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time,
<note place="margin">☜</note> but afterwards:
<note place="margin">N.

                        <p>Or (as a late writer anſwereth) About 34 years after that <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites</hi> had fought againſt the predeceſſour of <hi>Balack</hi> the ſon of <hi>Zippor</hi> King of <hi>Moah,</hi> and had taken all his Land, even unto <hi>Arnon; Iſrael</hi> ſmote <hi>Sihon</hi> and all his people, &amp; poſſeſſed his Country: Which was in the laſt year of <hi>Moſes.</hi> From whence unto <hi>Ieptha</hi> were but 266 years current; yet by adding the years of their owne poſſeſſion unto <hi>Sihon's</hi> whoſe right they had by the Law of Conqueſt, <hi>Ieptha</hi> did juſtly ſay, that they had dwelt in or poſſeſſed thoſe Countries 300 years.

Verily if that time were a ſpace of 450 years, then (what with the forty years in the Wilderneſſe, the whole time of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> the forty years of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> the forty of <hi>David,</hi> and the four of <hi>Solomon</hi>)
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115738:46"/>the whole time from the comming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, will be almoſt 600 years.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, it will not: For it is anſwered, either that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which ſignifieth 400, was miſtaken by the ſcribe and put for <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which is but three hundred: or elſe that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reckoned as they did who reckoned the years of the Oppreſſours ſo as they added them to the years of the Judges, and not included them.</p>
                        <p>As for the firſt,
<note place="margin">Beroald. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. Chronol. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> it might be granted were it not that all Copies have 450. For we doe not know (ſaith <hi>Beroaldus</hi>) of any Copy, either Greek or Latine, which hath 350, but (as the ordinary reading is) 450. And therefore we cannot think either that there was a fault in the ſcribe, or that after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time ſome one or other
<note n="*" place="margin">Maſter <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> thinketh ſo, in his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> took in hand to correct the text, according to their underſtanding of the Book of Judges, as Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> ſuppoſeth. For (as another ſpeaketh) <hi>Non eſt cur dicamus omnes Codices Graecos &amp; Latinos eſſe corruptos: cum ſuppeditat expedita conciliationis ratio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And therefore (according to the ſecond ſolution) we may rather think that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reckoned as they did, who took the years of the Oppreſſours and added them to the years of the Judges: accounting thoſe times apart, which are of right to be included.</p>
                        <p>As for Example: When <hi>Jabin</hi> oppreſſed <hi>Iſrael, Deborah</hi> was one who Judged at the ſame time, <hi>Judges</hi> 4.4. And when the Philiſtines oppreſſed, then was <hi>Sampſon</hi> a Judge: For (ſaith the text) He judged. <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the dayes of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, twenty years, <hi>Iudges</hi> 15.20. By which two places I doubt not but we are taught how to account the reſt.</p>
                        <p>The maine objection is, how the Land can be ſaid to have reſt 40 years after the overthrow of <hi>Chuſan</hi> by whom they were afflicted eight years, or eighty after the overthrow of <hi>Eglon,</hi> if part of thoſe years it were vexed with war, and the people held by their oppreſſours under a miſerable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
                        <p>But to this I finde a late writer, in his Annotations upon the place, give a fair anſwer; <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not unuſuall in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115738:47"/>the Scripture to denominate a full number of years, from that which is properly true onely of the greater part of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; as we ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.26. Where after the naming of the twelve ſons of <hi>Iacob,</hi> this clauſe is added, Theſe are the ſons of <hi>Iacob</hi> that were born to him in <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> and yet <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> is mentioned amongſt them, who was not born in <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> but in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and ſo likewiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.14. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſent and called his Father and all his kindred, threeſcore and fifteen ſouls, and yet indeed there went but threeſcore and ten of them at that time into <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 46.27. And ſo againe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.40. where it is ſaid, that the ſojourning of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who dwelt in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> was four hundred and thirty years, and yet they were not in <hi>Egypt</hi> after <hi>Iacobs</hi> going thither above two hundred and fifteen years. And therefore in that it is ſaid, And the Land had reſt forty years, the meaning may well be, that the Land had reſt to the end of forty years, to wit, counting the forty years from the death of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> to the death of <hi>Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel;</hi> and ſo of the reſt where the like phraſe is found. And ſo indeed <hi>Tremelius</hi> tranſlates theſe words, <hi>uſque ad quadrageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum annum,</hi> unto the expiration of forty years. Which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by the like expreſſion, in the fourteenth Chap. at the ſeventeenth verſe, where it is ſaid of <hi>Sampſons</hi> wife, that ſhe wept before him the ſeven dayes while the feaſt laſted: and yet the meaning is onely, that ſhe wept to the ending of thoſe ſeven dayes, to wit, from the time he refuſed to tell her the meaning of his Riddle.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Genealogies from <hi>Rahab</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> doe make it yet more manifeſt. For <hi>Rahab</hi> hid the ſpies; She was the mother of <hi>Boaz;</hi> He the father of <hi>Obed;</hi> and <hi>Obed</hi> of <hi>Ieſſe;</hi> and <hi>Ieſſe</hi> of <hi>David.</hi> Now though <hi>Rahab</hi> ſhould bring forth <hi>Boaz</hi> at 80; and <hi>Boaz</hi> beget <hi>Obed</hi> at 120; and <hi>Obed Ieſſe</hi> at 120; and <hi>Ieſſe David</hi> at 120: yet all theſe far ſtretched ages would fall ſhort of 450.</p>
                        <p>How Saint <hi>Paul</hi> therefore reckoned, is apparent: and his true meaning is explained, without wrong to any text. For in mentioning 450, it is with a clauſe of <hi>Proviſo;</hi> ſaying, not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115738:47"/>abſolutely God gave them Judges 450 years, but as it were (or after a ſort) 450 years. Which is as if it ſhould be ſaid, they were 450 years by adding the Judges and Opreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours years together:
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Joſeph</hi> Antiq. <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> after which manner the Jews (as we ſee by <hi>Joſephus</hi>) uſed to reckon theſe times. For <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſetteth the building of the Temple, five hundred ninty years and one, after the departure of the Iſraelites out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> which in an expreſſe text of Scripture, is but 480; as at the firſt I ſhewed, out of the 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.1. and have hitherto cleared it to be ſo, againſt all objections made to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Howbeit, ſome perhaps may not as yet be fully ſatisfyed untill I further ſpeak my minde concerning the opinions of <hi>Codoman</hi> and <hi>Petavius,</hi> who have declined the common path, and pitched upon an Interpretation ſerving rather to enlarge this Period, then to open the truth of the reckoning.</p>
                        <p>And as for <hi>Codoman,</hi>

And whereas Saint <hi>Paul</hi> nameth 450, he findes 20 years to make up Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> number, to have been ſpent after the death of <hi>Joſhua</hi> by the Seniours, before the Oppreſſion under <hi>Chuſan.</hi> After which to make all this reconcilable with the account of the 480 years in the 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.1. he ſaith we muſt begin to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, not in the beginning, but in the ending of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of the Iſraelites from <hi>Egypt,</hi> which he makes to be 25 years after the beginning of <hi>Othniels</hi> government; from whence if we caſt the years of the Judges with the years of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and ſo to theſe years add the 40 of <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> the 40 of <hi>David</hi> and the three of <hi>Salomon,</hi> we ſhall have the juſt ſum of 480 years.

                        <p>And next, how their journying ſhould be ſaid to have had an end, not till the 25 year after the victory of <hi>Othniel,</hi> is (ſaith he) becauſe all the Tribes had not obtained their poſſeſſions till then; at which time the <hi>Danites</hi> at length ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as is declared, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115738:49"/>at the end whereof the Land is left deſolate of all her Inhabitants, in the three and twentieth yeare of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> almoſt 427. yeares after the Temple began to be built. For the firſt yeare of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was
<note n="*" place="margin">Becauſe K. <hi>Salomon</hi> reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 40. years and but 3, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he began to build the Temple.</note> 37 yeares after King <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> began to lay the foundation: to which if we add 390. we have 427. Now out of this number we muſt deduct 4 (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Temple was burnt in the nineteenth yeare of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> as appeares 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.8.9.) and then there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main 423. the whole time of the years that the Temple ſtood. And as for the Moneths and dayes that were more, they were I ſay three <hi>Iulian</hi> Moneths and about eight dayes: for King <hi>Salomon</hi> laid the foundation on the laſt day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> and on the eighth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> it was deſtroyed. And then againe, that there were 37 years from the fourth of King <hi>Salomon</hi> to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 390. yeares of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the firſt yeare of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> when he concluded for the ſetting up of his Idolatry, is true: for indeed there were 37 yeares, threeſore dayes and one: For (as I ſaid before) King <hi>Salomon</hi> laid the foundation of the Temple on the laſt day of <hi>Aprill</hi> in the yeare of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 3703. and <hi>Ieroboam</hi> concluded with his Councill for the the ſetting up of his Idolatry on the laſt day of <hi>Iune,</hi> which was the three and twentieth day of the third month in the year of the <hi>Period Iulion</hi> 3740: from whence to the laſt of <hi>June</hi> in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4130 were 390 years. In that year therefore 4130, about the later end of <hi>Iune,</hi> before the full end of the 23 year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the 390 years of the ſin of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the 40 years of the ſin of <hi>Iudah</hi> ended. For we may not think that theſe 390 began preciſely on the fifteenth day of the eighth moneth, when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> inſtituted a Feaſt for the worſhip of his golden Calves, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſame year, <hi>viz.</hi> when he and his Councill had concluded for the making of them, or being made when he firſt ſet them in open view, and ſaid, Behold thy Gods O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which brought thee up out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12.28. which without ſcruple I take to be on the 23 day of the third moneth, as is aforeſaid; on which day the Jews faſt, becauſe of this which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did.</p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:115738:50"/>
                        <p>And note further, that the reaſon why I ſay theſe 390 years end not untill near four years after the Temple was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, is becauſe <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had not done all that he was to do againſt <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> untill the 23 year of his reign, at which time that ſmall remnant which was left in the Land with <hi>Gedaliah,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Joſeph Antiq. <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> was carryed away, the number then carryed being 745, as is recorded, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.15. For now at this time (being about four years after the Temple was burnt) <hi>Nebuza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radan</hi> a Captain of the guard was ſent by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to carry all away; which he did: and ſo there was none of the poſterity of <hi>Iſrael</hi> left remaining in the Land to provoke the Lord, either by their ſins which they learned of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> or by their ſins of that Idolatry which they learned of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> 390 years before. For albeit the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ceaſed to be in the ninth year of <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> yet there this reckoning of 390 may not end, but is ſtill accounted till a full end be made, and that the Lord
<note n="*" place="margin">2 Kin. 23.27.</note> remove <hi>Iudah</hi> out of his ſight as well as <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſome reliques of <hi>Iſrael</hi> remaining among thoſe of <hi>Iudah</hi> till the whole number of 390 was accompliſhed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yound which time, God in that holy Land of Promiſe would not endure the ſin of <hi>Iſrael</hi> any more, which comming from <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had infected even them of <hi>Iudah</hi> too, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.16.19. and therefore could not be throughly rooted out untill all (as well of <hi>Iudah</hi> as of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) were carryed out of that good Land given to their Fathers many hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>This againe is proved by another number;
<note place="margin">Ezek. 4.6.</note> a number of 40 years, taught us alſo by <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> For albeit the number of 390 (as it is whole) hath relation to both houſes, yet 40 years of that reckoning are in more particular, pertinent onely to the houſe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the thirtieth year whereof agreeth with the fifth year of <hi>Zedechia, Ezekiel</hi> 1.1. and therefore the laſt muſt needs reach to the 23 of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the eighteenth of <hi>Ioſiah:</hi> from which year the whole number of theſe 40 years are undoubtedly to be accounted. For in that year <hi>Huldah</hi> the Propheteſſe did foretell the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable deſtruction of <hi>Iudah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22, 3, 15, 16, &amp;c. Then
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115738:50"/>did <hi>Ioſiah</hi> celebrate a ſolemne Paſſeover; then was it that the book of the Law, which had been loſt, was found and read: at the hearing whereof the good King wept, the people (for their Sins) being threatned with Captivity. But from that evill to come <hi>Joſiah</hi> had a promiſe to be taken away before it came: whoſe Godly courſes ſhould have moved his godleſſe Subjects; But they (though bad before) growing then to be worſe and worſe, are fitly ſaid to begin this burden of their 40 years ſin, declining ſo far from a wiſhed Converſion, that finally they fell into a diſmall deſtruction. Yea then was it that the Altar in <hi>Bethel</hi> was deſtroyed; and ſo, as the 390 years began in that year when <hi>Jeroboham</hi> cauſed the ſaid Altar to be built: in like manner theſe 40 years began in that year wherein <hi>Joſiah</hi> cauſed it to be beaten down. For though it were a time of Reformation in reſpect of what <hi>Joſiah</hi> did, yet not being followed on by the people and Kings after him (though threatned by <hi>Huldah</hi> with deſtruction) it is of all things herein the moſt probable that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was moved to have reſpect thereunto, when he was commanded to ſet apart 40 years from his 390, and appropriate them to <hi>Judah</hi> in more particular then when he joyned the ſins of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> both together.</p>
                        <p>All which is likewiſe ſeen in the fifth Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> for the Prophet there by ſhaving his head, and parting the haire, ſheweth <hi>Judah's</hi> caſe. One part he burnt with fire: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part he cut with a ſword: a third part he ſcattered into the winde: One part he bound up; and ſoone after he burnt even that part alſo. So <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with her Inhabitants ſhould periſh by fire &amp; ſword, with other miſerable deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And albeit a ſmall remnant was left for a while with <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> yet ſoone after they alſo ſhall be brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; which accordingly came to paſſe in the three and twentieth year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when cleane riddance is made of all out of their owne Land, ſignified by that part of haire which for a time was bound up, and at the laſt taken and burnt.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the length of this Period is likewiſe proved by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115738:51"/>two Sabbathicall years; the one in the dayes of <hi>Hezekia,</hi> the other in the dayes of <hi>Zedechia</hi> Kings of <hi>Judah:</hi> and both theſe noted in Scripture; the one by the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Chapter</hi> 37. <hi>verſe</hi> 30. The other by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, Chapter</hi> 34. <hi>verſe</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>That which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> mentions began in the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeare of <hi>Hezekia,</hi> in the yeare after the Temple was founded 302, and yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4004, and was Sabbathicall till the Autumne next after: at which time they ſowed their fields which had reſted from the Autumn before, as the law required. For this we are to note, That that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which <hi>Senacharib</hi> began againſt the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the latter end of the 14 year of <hi>Hezekia</hi> was an expedition of
<note n="*" place="margin">Eſay 20.3.4.</note> three yeares, and intended chiefly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and therefore ended not till after the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt time of the year of the Julian Period 4004 when his hoſt was ſlain by an Angell. For in the year of the ſame Period 4001 (the fourteenth year of <hi>Hezekia</hi> tending towards an end) <hi>Senacharib</hi> began it, and invaded ſome part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Judah</hi> firſt, where he took no few of the defenced Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 36.1. About which time <hi>Hezekia</hi> fell ſick, and upon his recovery had a promiſe not onely that his life ſhould be prolonged for fifteen years, but alſo that he and his City ſhould be delivered out of the hand of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Eſay</hi> 38.5.6. Which ſtory is indeed mentioned after the death of <hi>Senacharib,</hi> but in generall termes in reſpect of the time; as thus: In <hi>diebus illis,</hi> In thoſe dayes: <hi>Petavius</hi> therefore had no juſt cauſe to blame <hi>Torniellus</hi> for his account herein. And as God had made this promiſe, ſo he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed it, and drew away <hi>Senacharib</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with <hi>Sethon</hi> the King thereof in the year of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Period 4002, and came not into <hi>Judea</hi> againe untill the year 4004: the harveſt of which year was thereupon ſpoyled and troden out in the fields. The next year had no harveſt at all by reaſon of the year of Reſt which began at the Autumne before. But in the year 4006 there was an harveſt again: as was foretold in <hi>Eſay</hi> 37.30. And thus is that place in <hi>Eſay</hi> to be underſtood.</p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:115738:51"/>

                        <p>THis next Period is the time that the Temple lay waſt, and is a Period of 68 years compleat; the firſt whereof began in the year of the Julian Period 4126, and the laſt was ended in the year of the ſame Period 4194, which was the firſt year of the 65 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 228 of <hi>Nabonaſſar,</hi> and ſecond of <hi>Darius</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hyſtaſpis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This the Prophet ſheweth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.12. Where he telleth that the ſecond year of that <hi>Darius</hi> who gave order by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict for the building again of the Temple, was the ſeventieth year from the deſolation of the Cities of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> For <hi>Oh Lord of Hoſts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how long ſhall it be before thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt pitty on</hi> Hieruſalem, <hi>and on the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>with which thou haſt been angry:</hi> This is the ſeventieth year. Thus that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: In which words we are to note, firſt that theſe 70 years, at the time mentioned, were not compleate, but current; And ſecondly that they are to begin at the demonſtration of Gods wrath fully and firmely fixed againſt the Cities of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> which I take to be then when the Jews were made to ſee and perceive that their great hopes of helpe from <hi>Egypt</hi> were become fruſtrate and void, <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Army being beaten back from the ſuccour of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who put that Army to flight, and then returned againe to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> againſt which they then laid that ſiege, which from thenceforth continued without any further interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on untill the City was taken. Now this returne I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted to be on the fourth day of <hi>May,</hi> in the year of the Julian Period 4125: from whence to the fourth of <hi>May</hi> in the year of the ſame Period 4195 are fully 70 years. But
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115738:59"/>becauſe theſe years were not compleat at the time when the Angel made mention of them, we ſhal not need to deſcend ſo low as the fourth of <hi>May</hi> on which they were ended, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and indeed have recourſe (as the ſeventh verſe ſheweth) to the 24 day of the eleventh moneth, whilſt the ſecond year of <hi>Darius</hi> was ſtill running on: and ſo doing we ſhall come as I take it, to the twelfe day of <hi>February</hi> which was before the fourth day of <hi>May</hi> before mentioned; at which time not only was the ſeventieth year unfiniſhed, but alſo the ſecond of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was not ended: for the years of <hi>Darius</hi> did ſo begin and end, as one year of his reigne did certainly partake with two years of the Julian Period. And therefore though the ſecond year of <hi>Darius</hi> here mentioned began in the year of the Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Period 4194, yet it was not ended in that year, but at the leaſt did reach beyond <hi>March</hi> in the year 4195; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the third day of <hi>Adar</hi> which was about the tenth day of <hi>March</hi> in that yeare when this Temple was finiſhed. See <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6.15.</p>
                        <p>And thus is this a plain proofe: howbeit I finde it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> not onely in his Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon <hi>Euſebius,</hi> but
<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>lib.</hi> 6. De E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendat. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por.</note> elſewhere; affirming that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was not reſtored untill the ſecond year of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> near an hundred years later then this ſecond of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But what though <hi>Joſeph Scaliger</hi> thinketh ſo? <hi>Joſephus</hi> the Jew thought otherwiſe; ſo did the ancient Chriſtian Fathers, <hi>Clemens, Euſebius, Auguſtine, Hierom,</hi> and others. <hi>Severus Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius</hi> indeed is of <hi>Scaligers</hi> ſide, and ſo doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> alſo confuſedly ſeem to be, beſide many other late writers, who take part with <hi>Scaliger:</hi> but we may juſtly call them all into queſtion with him in this particular; not out of any Spirit of contradiction, but for the advancement of a more likely truth. For what ſaith the Prophet <hi>Haggai, c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3? Who is he among you who ſaw this Houſe in her firſt glory? and how doe ye ſee it now? Is it not in your eyes, in compariſon of it, as nothing? yet now be ſtrong, &amp;c. By which words we ſee that both Houſes muſt be in the memory of a man,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115738:60"/>and ſome muſt be then alive who ſaw both: which in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Nothus,</hi> upon due conſideration, will be ſcarce thought probable.</p>
                        <p>The like may be alſo thought concerning the ages of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who were in office in the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and ſo continued till the Temple was built, and after: but from the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the ſecond of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> were an hundred and thirteen years; and from the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Temple in the nineteenth of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to the ſame time, an hundred ſixty and five years: to which muſt be added ſuch a competent number of years more as ſhall make them who are officers capable of office, and the other apt to remember from the time that we account; and ſo to remember, as that they be able to judge between the glory of the one Houſe, and the glory of the other Houſe, which a childe of few years could not doe. And note that theſe diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are thus, in regard that the ninteenth of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was in the year of the Julian Period 4126; the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> over <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the year of the Julian Period 4178; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> in the year of the Julian Period 4291.</p>
                        <p>But the adverſe party have anſwered. And firſt (ſay they) we miſtake the Prophet <hi>Zachary.</hi> For although he ſpeaketh of 70 years in the dayes of <hi>Darius,</hi> yet he doth not meane that thoſe 70 years ended but then. His meaning rather is, that the Jews had endured the 70 years of Captivity which were prophecyed of, and yet they ſaw not the full reſtitution of their City and Country: and therefore ſaith the Angel, <hi>Domine, quouſque? Lord, How long? &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, The 70 years for the deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are long ſince ended, and wilt thou ſtill be angry with thy people?</p>
                        <p>Which anſwer though it may a little colour the buſineſſe, is nothing at all convincing: for the words of the Text doe plainely ſhew that the laſt of thoſe years was but then when the Prophet had his viſion: and therefore ſaith the Angel, This is the ſeventieth year. Which (as at the firſt verſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth) was even then when the word of the Lord came to <hi>Zedechiah</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Darius.</hi> To which reply

And if but <hi>a young man</hi> in <hi>Darius</hi> his time, and yet a Prophet before when <hi>Cyrus</hi> reigned, in whoſe ſecond year the foundation of this Temple was laid, how can it be that the time for the building of it ſhould be ſo late as the reigne of <hi>Darius Nothus?</hi> for if <hi>Zachary</hi> lived till then, he muſt not be young, but very old, <hi>Zacha.</hi> 8.9.</p>
                        <p>Beſide, in the ſeventh chapter of the ſame Prophecy, at the firſt and fifth verſes, the Prophet againe ſpeakes of 70 years in the fourth year of <hi>Darius,</hi> which being accounted from the year of the Julian Period 4126. (when both City and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were deſtroyed) doe end exactly in the fourth year of <hi>Darius,</hi> as is required, not <hi>Nothus,</hi> but <hi>Hyſtaſpis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Go we on therefore to the next, Neither is it granted (ſay they) that the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> ſpeaketh of any who had ſeen both Temples. For by an uſuall manner of ſpeaking the phraſe of the Prophet imports but this: namely, That if any were alive who had ſeen the former Temple, he would take this latter as nothing to that. For when the Prophet ſaith, who is he among you, &amp;c. he doth but expreſſe himſelfe as our Saviour did in the Parable of the loſt ſheepe, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4. ſaying, which of you having an hundred ſheepe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, If any among you having an hundred ſheepe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.12. Thus they anſwer. But here is no Parable; nor will the words ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any ſuch gloſſe. For the Prophet ſpeaketh to them in the ſecond perſon, ſaying: Is it not in your eyes? that is, In yours which did know and ſee the other Temple. This is the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115738:61"/>plain ſenſe without any wreſting or flying from that which was ſpoken properly to what was ſpoken Parabolically. One therefore ſaith <hi>Sed hoc feſtivum eſt; &amp; nulla reſponſione dignum, quod locum allegatum Haggaei prophetae in modum Parabolae accipiunt.</hi>

And if the children of the Captivity, then not the children of a new Age; as by and by ſhall be further manifeſt. And if not the children of a new Age; then they were ſuch as had ſeen as well the former as the latter houſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Come we then to the next: to which they anſwer, That the Ages of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> though extended as far as <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> were not ſo long but that they might live till then.</p>
                        <p>So ſay I; they might live ſo long; But that they did, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improbable: and moſt of all that they ſhould live ſo long fit for action and publike employment. For by this account they muſt be in office together 117. yeares at the leaſt, from the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the ſixth of <hi>Darius Nothus:</hi> but how old they were when they entred on their office, how long in it before the Captivity ended, or at what time they dyed after the Temple was finiſhed, is not declared. And indeed it is too much to grant, without better evidence, that in an hundred &amp; ſeventeen yeares and more ſhould be but one high Prieſt, and that in the times following (being about 115. yeares) till the end of this <hi>Monarchie</hi> there ſhould be five; as may be ſeen <hi>Neb.</hi> 12.10. I take therefore this proportion of time to be as true as that other aſſertion of theirs annexed hereunto, That in 150 yeares (for ſo long muſt be by them till <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> came up) there ſhould be but one governour, namely <hi>Zero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel;</hi> and that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was the next after him, none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming between: whereas the truth is, there were ſome between &amp; ſuch as had oppreſſed the people, mentioned by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> though not named who they were, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.15.</p>
                        <p>Beſide, in the twentieth yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes, Nehemiah</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115738:61"/>in what caſe they were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who were the remnant of the Captivity, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.2, 3. And if ſo long after the building of the Temple, as the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of them who went into Captivity were ſtill alive, the difficulty increaſeth, and cannot be removed but by yeilding to them who ſtand (as they ought) for the ſecond yeare of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hiſtaſpis.</hi> Which reply I ſhall confirme yet further by what is afterward mentioned by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> c. 7. v. 4. where he confeſſeth that the people in the City, in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> aforeſaid, were but few, and therefore many houſes ſtil unbuilt; giving thereby great ſuſpition ſtil to this ſuppoſed lengeh of time. For when they returned out of Captivity,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.64.</note> 
                           <hi>Ezra</hi> ſaith there were 42360. of them, beſide their men-ſervants and their maid-ſervants, of whom there were 7337. which added to the other do make 49697 in all. Now that in 150 years (for ſo long muſt be to the twentieth of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> who was after <hi>Darius Nothus</hi>) this company ſhould be no better increaſed, but that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> muſt complain of an empty City, is a thing very unlike, conſidering the naturall fruitfulneſſe of that Nation, and thoſe infinite multitudes whereunto they grew within 40 yeares after in ſpight of the continuall wars which dayly did conſume them.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps you wil ſay, the other Cities had emptied this, and therefore there were but few. Surely no: for (as may be gathered out of the eleventh Chapter of <hi>Nehemiah</hi>) thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had but 30440. in them; becauſe the Tythe,
<note place="margin">Neh. 11.1.</note> which was choſen by lot out of every company, amounted but to 3044.</p>
                        <p>There were therefore before this Tything was made, more in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the part (conſidering the company which came up at the firſt) then in the other Cities: which number ſurely would have been ſo much increaſed by <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, that he ſhould not have needed to have complained for lacke of inhabitants, if the time had been ſo long as <hi>Scaliger</hi> and his followers would make it.</p>
                        <p>But they object further concerning the time of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that it could not be till the dayes of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115738:62"/>the decree which <hi>Cyrus</hi> made concerning it was forgotten; witneſſe the great ſearch that was made about it, no man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live being able to remember it.</p>
                        <p>To which I anſwer, that the Adverſaries of the <hi>Jewes</hi> would be ſure to carry the matter againſt them as cunningly as they could; and therefore having recourſe to a King newly come to his throne, they might and did deſire ſearch to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Rols, hoping that either <hi>Cyrus</hi> had not regiſtred the Decree that he made (eſpecially ſeeing it concerned not his owne people) or elſe that it might be loſt through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; or elſe theſe might be other and younger Adverſaries then thoſe who at the firſt withſtood the building; &amp; therefore on their own knowledge could not remember it. Nay though there might be enough alive who could eaſily remember the departing of the <hi>Jewes</hi> home againe into their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; yet that the building of their Temple was granted by Decree, and that Decree regiſtred, but few regarded; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed might rather thinke there was no ſuch thing then that there was, becauſe the building was hindred in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his life time, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſheweth. For in the third yeare of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Perſia</hi> withſtood it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.1.13.</p>
                        <p>But they have this to object, That for all this it muſt be <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> who reſtored the Temple, and not that other <hi>Darius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hystaſpis,</hi> becauſe (as <hi>Ezra,</hi> c. 4.) it muſt be ſuch a <hi>Darius</hi> as had an <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> before him, and an <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> after him: which none of the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> had but <hi>Darius Nothus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To which is anſwered, that <hi>Cambyſes</hi> ſucceeding his Father in the throne is called by <hi>Ezra,</hi> c. 4. verſ. 6. by the name of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> which was his Imperial name; and was ſo called as being the firſt that obtained the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchie by the right of inheritance: for ſuch (ſaith Maſter <hi>Lydiat</hi>) is the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> or <hi>Aſſuerus.</hi> Nor will <hi>Scaliger</hi> himſelfe but confeſſe that it was ordinary with theſe Kings to change their names when they tooke the Government of the Empire upon them, as <hi>Cluverus</hi> obſerveth in his <hi>Computo Chronologico. Cambyſes</hi> therefore is not unfitly taken for <hi>Ahaſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115738:62"/>Ezra</hi> 4.6. Next after whom was <hi>Magus</hi> the <hi>Magician,</hi> who reigned under the name of the brother of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> the other ſon of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> called by <hi>Cteſias</hi> (not <hi>Smerdis,</hi> as in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> but) <hi>Tanyoxarces,</hi> or <hi>Tanyoxerxes:</hi> the ſame ſure which <hi>Ezra</hi> calleth <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> or <hi>Arthaſhaſt, Ezra</hi> 4.7. So that thus we have the firſt <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> he who was before <hi>Darius.</hi> And as for the other after him, we need not make queſtion but he was <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus:</hi> For though <hi>Longimanus</hi> did not immediately ſucceed <hi>Darius,</hi> yet was he the firſt King after him who ſhewed favour in the reſtoring <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If they ſay the reigne of the <hi>Magician</hi> was too ſhort to have any hand in the hindring the building of the Temple; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it was not ſo ſhort as ſome may imagine: for though he reigned but ſeven moneths after the death of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> yet was not that the whole time of his reigne: for he ſat in the throne a good while before, even moſt of the time that <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi> was out of <hi>Perſia</hi> making war in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Ammonians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To all which, <hi>Petavius</hi> well accordeth, in his twelfth book and 25 Chapter, <hi>De Doctrina Temporum:</hi> where noting the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> in that order wherein they ſtand in the book of <hi>Ezra,</hi> thus he ſaith; The firſt is <hi>Cyrus,</hi> then <hi>Aſſuerus, cap.</hi> 4.6. to whom the Jews were accuſed. Then <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> verſe 7. who alſo favoured the Jews enemies, and forbad the building of the Temple. Afterwards <hi>Darius, cap.</hi> 5. in whoſe ſecond year the Temple is reſtored. And after him <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (ſaith he) who is mentioned next after <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> was not <hi>Longimanus;</hi> but either the ſame with <hi>Aſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> thinketh: ſuppoſing <hi>Cambyſes</hi> to be ſignified by both thoſe names; to whom <hi>Torniellus</hi> agreeth. Or elſe to ſpeak truely, <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> is <hi>Cambyſes;</hi> and <hi>Smerdis</hi> (the <hi>Magician</hi>) <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who cunningly held the Empire eight moneths after <hi>Cambyſes:</hi> and hath ſome of his acts remembred by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus;</hi> as that he ſhould free his ſubjects from tribute, and grant them a ceſſation from military employments for the ſpace of three years, yea even for almoſt ſix years did this

                        <p>THis ſeventh Period is a Period of 65 years: which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better demonſtrate then by running through the reignes of all the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> from the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the end of the laſt <hi>Darius</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> conquered.</p>
                        <p>I begin then with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who by the conſent of all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours began to reigne in the firſt year of the 55 <hi>Olympiad; viz.</hi> in the latter part thereof, which was in the year of the Julian Period 4155, at the Summer time whereof the ſecond year of the ſaid <hi>Olympiad</hi> began.

                        </p>
                        <p>The next after <hi>Cyrus</hi> was <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> who had ſome kinde of Dominion in the third year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſheweth; but from his Fathers death (who dyed in the year of the Julian Period 4185) to his owne death, he had but ſeven years and five moneths, as it is teſtifyed by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and confirmed by <hi>Ptolomie.</hi> In <hi>Cteſias</hi> his fragment we finde 18: which I beleeve to be a corruption, and ſhould more rightly be eight; the laſt of which was incompleat, as by the ſeven years and five mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths noted in <hi>Herodotus</hi> well appeareth.</p>
                        <p>This King <hi>Cambyſes</hi> went to war in <hi>Egypt</hi> in the third year of the ſixty third <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which was in the year of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Period 4188; as <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſheweth, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. during which time of his war there, and in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> his Kingdome at home was governed partly by his owne brother <hi>Tanyoxerxes,</hi> and partly by one of the <hi>Magoi</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> who ſlew his brother and then counterfeted his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115738:64"/>and under the vaile of his name held the Empire til the death of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> and ſeven moneths after, at which time the chiefe Nobles of <hi>Perſia</hi> diſcovering the fraud ſlew him, and advanced <hi>Darius</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hyſtaſpis</hi> to the throne in the year of the Julian Period 4193.</p>

In which diverſity, all the helpe that we have is from <hi>Herodotus;</hi> who, though he give him 36 years, doth nevertheleſſe declare that he dyed in the fifth year after the <hi>Marathon</hi> war: which war was not till the ſecond year of the ſeventy ſecond <hi>Olympiad,</hi> in which was the one and thirtieth year of his reigne: And therefore the whole time of his reigne could be but 34 years compleate, as <hi>Julianus Toletanus</hi> reckoneth; And of theſe he reigned but 33 before his ſon <hi>Xerxes</hi> was taken in to reigne with him, as in <hi>Herodotus</hi> again appeareth, <hi>lib.</hi> 7.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Xerxes</hi> therfore began in the year of the Julian Period 4226, and (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſaith) reigned ſomething more then twenty years: after whom <hi>Artabanus</hi> (by whom <hi>Xerxes</hi> was ſlain) continued ſeven moneths, and at the end thereof <hi>Artabanus</hi> alſo being ſlain, <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> began to reigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and dyed not untill the ſeventh year of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War in the winter time thereof; <hi>viz,</hi> in the year of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Period 4289 almoſt finiſhed; as both <hi>Thucidides</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> witneſſe, <hi>Thucid. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Diodor. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Cteſias</hi> therefore was right in giving 42 years to this King after the death of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But we are to note that this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had a twofold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to reigne: The one, ſome years before his Father <hi>Xerxes</hi> dyed: The other after his Fathers death, when he had ſlain <hi>Artabanus,</hi> who ſlew his Father ſeven moneths before. From the firſt he reigned 49 years: and from the ſecond but 42, as hath been ſhewed. The firſt began in the year of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115738:64"/>the Julian Period 4240 towards the end thereof, even before the beginning of the ſeventh moneth: the other, in the year of the ſame Period 4247.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thucidides</hi> hath an eye to the firſt of theſe, and ſo have the holy Scriptures in accounting the years of this King: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old Authours generally account from the latter time, when he began to reigne alone; in which <hi>Diodorus</hi> a little differeth from <hi>Cteſias,</hi> and hath therefore but 40 years in the ſtead of 42.</p>
                        <p>But now why this King ſhould begin in his Fathers life time, and ſo ſoon as I have mentioned, is in regard of what we finde ſtoryed concerning the baniſhment of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian,</hi> who being expelled out of <hi>Athens</hi> by his unthankfull Country-men and Citizens, fled to the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> for ſuccour in the ſecond year of the ſeventy ſeventh <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus</hi> caſts the time: and then we are ſure <hi>Xerxes</hi> was liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe the time of his reigne was ſomething more then twenty years. <hi>Diodorus</hi> hereupon ſaith that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> came to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and ſo doe ſome others; but <hi>Thucidides</hi> who was near thoſe times, as alſo <hi>Plutarch, Charon Lampſacenus,</hi> and <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> have witneſſed that he came to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> of late having begun to reigne. And if to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> of late having begun to reigne, it muſt needs follow that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had a beginning before the ſecond year of the 77 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which (as appeareth by the account of <hi>Daniels</hi> 70 Weeks) was in the year of the Julian Period 4240 about the ſixth moneth, which among the Jews was called <hi>Elul:</hi> and living after that till the ſeventh year of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, muſt needs have a longer time of reigne from this beginning then either forty or two and forty years.</p>
                        <p>But for a more clear demonſtration, and ſo to reconcile theſe Authours that they may ſpeak true on either ſide, let me add out of <hi>Petavius,</hi> namely, That <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed came to come to <hi>Xerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus</hi> and diverſe other Story-writers declare; and finding <hi>Xerxes</hi> buſied in ſome expedition, or not in the City which was the ſeate of his Kingdome, he ſent letters to his ſon <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> who of late had began to reigne, as <hi>Thucidides</hi> ſheweth. For
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115738:65"/>in this reſpect Story-writers may indifferently relate that he fled as well to the one as the other: and our concluſion from hence may be, that he fled to the <hi>Perſians, Xerxes</hi> yet living, when <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was already taken in to reigne with him in the Empire, as being the next that was to reigne alone after him. Thus <hi>Xerxes</hi> alſo began to reigne before <hi>Darius</hi> dyed, as hath been proved out of <hi>Herodotus.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Petay. <hi>lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</note> For according to a Law among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> when the King went to war abroad, he did for the moſt part appoint and conſtitute one of his ſons for his ſucceſſour; from which time ſome Authours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the years of ſuch an ones reigne, whileſt others ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but from the time of his Fathers death. And in the Kingdome of <hi>Babylon, Nebuchadnezzars</hi> reigne began after the ſame manner, as by <hi>Beroſus</hi> compared with holy Scripture may be ſeen. This was uſuall alſo among the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as by the Scripture alone is: manifeſt: which not obſerved, hath cauſed many groſſe miſtakes concerning the right reckoning of their reignes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Euſebius</hi> mentions the flight of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> two years ſooner then <hi>Diodorus</hi> doth, who therefore caſteth it into the fourth year of the ſeventy ſixth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which was in the year of the Julian Period 4241, and then was the firſt year of <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> ſtill running on by my account.</p>
                        <p>This of <hi>Euſebius</hi> I finde approved by a late learned writer, <hi>Jacobus Armachanus</hi> in his Annals of holy Scripture; who ſayes that it agrees conveniently enough to the tradition of <hi>Thucidides,</hi> which ſetteth the comming of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> between the ſiege of <hi>Naxus</hi> and that noble victory gotten by <hi>Cimon</hi> over the <hi>Perſians</hi> at <hi>Eurimedon;</hi> and doth withall place the beginning of the reigne of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe bounds. For

                           </gap>, of late having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to reigne; by which he both deſired his friendſhip, and alſo promiſed his owne aide to him againſt the Greekes. From which is found out the true beginning of the reigne of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and is from hence proved not to be ſo late by nine years as is commonly accounted. Thus he, in his Annals I ſay of holy Scripture: which when I ſaw, I was not a little
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115738:65"/>confirmed in my judgment. For though I accounted thus, long before I ever read any thing of his in this kinde; yet for my better confirmation herein, I was glad to meete with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of ſo eminent a man: from whom though I varie much in the ancient account of the Hebrew moneths and year, as alſo in ſome other particulars; yet here (as in many things elſewhere) I cannot but embrace him with much glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſhall ever eſteeme him (as ſure enough he is) a man of excellent parts, great induſtry, piety, and much learning, worthy to be accounted among the number of thoſe whoſe memories are precious after their deaths.</p>
                        <p>But to returne: There is moreover a paſſage mentioned by <hi>Petavius,</hi> out of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> to ſhew the occaſion of this begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as may be ſeen in his <hi>Doctrina Temporum, lib.</hi> 10. c. 25. where he alſo anſwereth to what <hi>Pererius</hi> objecteth againſt it. And indeed it is probable that when <hi>Xerxes</hi> (upon the death of <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> who ſhould have betrayed <hi>Greece</hi> to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but was diſcovered) went about to renew his war againſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> that then he tooke this his ſonne <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to reign with him, and to be his next ſucceſſour, which <hi>Artabanus</hi> afterwards would have hindered and made void, but could not.</p>
                        <p>The next after this <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was <hi>Xerxes</hi> the ſecond who reigned two Months, or (as <hi>Cteſias</hi> ſaith) 45 days. After whom <hi>Sogdianus</hi> had ſeven or eight Moneths more: And when <hi>Sog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus</hi> was dead, <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> (in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od</hi> 4290) began to enter upon thoſe XIX. yeares which <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> ſaith was the time of his reigne: according to whom I reckon the yeares of all the other Kings in this Monarchie to the end thereof. And muſt therefore give to <hi>Artaxerxes Mne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> after the death of <hi>Nothus</hi> 43 years. To <hi>Artaxerxes Ochus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Mnemon</hi> 23. To <hi>Arſes</hi> after <hi>Ochus</hi> 3. And to <hi>Darius Codoman</hi> after <hi>Arſes</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>And thus we have all the Kings of this Monarchie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the yeares of their reigne: and do thereby finde the death of the laſt of them to be in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od</hi> 4384.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115738:68"/>after which time, the Apoſtles turne to the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.1. and <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18.</p>
                        <p>They were all of them Weeks (not of Days, but) of years; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of Prophetical Dayes, and years of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee: there being ſeven Weeks in 49 years, as is ſeen in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.8. Whereupon it followeth, that in ſeventy Weekes are 490 years. There can be no doubt of this: I may therefore goe on; and for the more cleare underſtanding of what I have already briefly touched, ſet downe the words of the text, in each verſe, at large.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ver.</hi> 24. Seventy Weekes is cut out upon thy people, and upon thy holy Cities, to finiſh tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſin, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſſe, and to ſeale up Viſion and Prophet, and to annoint the Moſt Holy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. Know therefore and underſtand, that from the Out-going of the word to returne and to build <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> unto <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the Prince ſhall be ſeven Weekes, and threeſcore and two Weekes: it ſhall be built againe, Street and Wall, even in the ſtrait of times.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. And after the threeſcore and two Weekes, ſhall <hi>Meſſiah</hi> be ſlain, but not for himſelfe: wherefore the Princes people to come ſhall deſtroy the City and the Sanctuary, and the end thereof ſhall be with a Flood, and unto the end of the War deſolations are determined.</p>
                        <p>Verſ. 27 But in one weeke he ſhall confirme the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with many; and in the midſt of the weeke he ſhall cauſe the Sacrifice and the Oblation to ceaſe: and by a Wing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations making deſolate, he ſhall flow upon the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, even untill the Conſummation determined.</p>
                        <p>Theſe be the words of the Prophecie, carefully tranſlated: which in the next place I thinke fit to open and explain, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon them as followeth.</p>
                        <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>[Seventy weekes is cut out]</hi> By which phraſe is meant, that the full and juſt number of 70 weekes is cut out. For when a Verb ſingular is joyned to a Subſtantive plurall, it teacheth in <hi>Hebrew</hi> that an exact account is then in every part
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115738:69"/>thereof fully intended.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thy people</hi>] that is, Thy Country men the <hi>Jewes;</hi> as may be ſeen in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Ruth,</hi> at the tenth verſe: where the <hi>Jewes</hi> are called <hi>Naomies</hi> people. The like is alſo in the third Chapter of the <hi>Lamentations</hi> at the fourteenth verſe; where <hi>Jeremy</hi> complaining, ſaith, He was a laughing ſtock to all his people.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thy Holy City</hi>] this meanes <hi>Jeruſalem, Eſa.</hi> 52.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.5. ſo called becauſe it was the ſpeciall place conſecrate to the holy worſhip of God. This Prerogative of being called <hi>The holy City,</hi> it was to retaine (as here appeareth) untill the full end of theſe 70. weekes: And therefore when Chriſt came, Salvation was firſt tendred to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> They in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall made light of it, and put Chriſt to death: howbeit the covenant of the Goſpell was confirmed with many of them during the time of the laſt week; which being ended, their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative ceaſed, and thereupon the Apoſtles turne to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom the Goſpell began not to be preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till three yeares and an halfe after Chriſts Paſſion, at which time every one of the Seventy weekes were fully ended. Now this holy City was called <hi>Daniels</hi> City, either becauſe he was born there or becauſe that was the place of his bringing up, or in which he dwelt till he was carryed away Captive. Thus <hi>Capernaum</hi> is called Chriſts City becauſe he dwelled in it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.1. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.3. So alſo <hi>Rogelim</hi> was the city of <hi>Barzil. lai,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.38.</p>

                           <hi>To finiſh tranſgreſſion and to make an end of ſinne</hi>] Or as ſome render it; To conſume wickedneſſe, and to aboliſh Sinnes: following therein the margent <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as an expoſition for plainneſſe. The text is to ſeale, or to make an end of Sinne ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Vt finem accipiat peccatum,</hi> that ſinne may have an end: as Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> interprets it &amp; is approved, therein by a great <hi>Hebrician,</hi> who ſaith that according to the true reading of the words, they ſignifie properly to conſume, finiſh or end Sin. This was fulfilled by Jeſus Chriſt, who was that Lamb of God which taketh away the Sinnes of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. To which agreeth that of the Apoſtle, Being then made free
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115738:69"/>from ſinne, ye became the ſervants of righteouſneſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18. And againe, But now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away Sinne, by the Sacrifice of himſelfe, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.26.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And to make reconciliation for iniquitie</hi>] This Chriſt did by appeaſing and pacifying the wrath of God againſt ſinne: and it was an effect of his paſſion. For by his death we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.20.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſſe</hi>] This Chriſt Jeſus alſo did. For by his owne blood he entred in once into the holy place, having obtained eternall redemption, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9 12.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And to ſeale up viſion and prophet</hi>] Meaning, that <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall make good, fulfill and performe all the prophecies that were of him, of his Paſſion and reſurrection, putting an end to them all, and that therefore we ought to looke for no other, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.31. This we are alſo taught in the firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the firſt verſ. where the Apoſtle ſaith, God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt times ſpoken unto us by his ſonne.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And to annoint the moſt Holy</hi>] Or the Holineſſe of Holineſſe: that is, the moſt holy. This is alſo meant of Chriſt, who was endued with the Holy Ghoſt without meaſure: even a very fountaine of holineſſe was in him, of whoſe fulneſſe we have all received, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
                        <p>In the time of the Law, the Kings, Prieſts &amp; Prophets, when they firſt tooke their Offices upon them, were annointed with holy oyle. And this was the Ceremony of conſecrating them to the ſervice of God in thoſe callings. Now Chriſt was both King, Prieſt, and Prophet: he had in himſelfe alone all thoſe dignities at once together, to the which others were annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeverally; and is therefore called by way of eminencie, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, The <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that is, the annointed. For though he were annointed with no materiall oyle, yet he was ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly annointed with the oyle of gladneſſe above his fellowes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. that is, with the holy Ghoſt. And hereupon it is that Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, Ye have an ointment from him that is holy, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20, 22.</p>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:115738:70"/>
                        <p>Neither doth Chriſt himſelfe but ſay as much: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon when he began to preach, he ſheweth how the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> pointed at him in this, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. It was an excellent ſaying therefore of <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> Our Lord Chriſt (ſaith he) the holy of holies, who came and fulfilled Viſion and Prophet, was annointed in the fleſh with the Spirit of his Father whoſe materiall annointings therefore of the Law; were nothing elſe but types &amp; figures of this ſpiritual annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſt, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Livelie</hi> concludeth. And I would to God he had kept him cloſe to this in his interpretation of the next verſe: for it is as clear as the Sun at noon that there is but one and the ſame <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſpoken of through out his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.</p>
                        <p>And thus have we ſeen the generality of <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes. Now followeth a more ſpeciall and particular handling them, divided into three parts in the verſes following.</p>
                        <p>Verſ.
<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 70 Weekes.</note> 25. <hi>From the out-going of the word</hi>] This is commonly underſtood of the publiſhing or proclaiming of a decree by ſome of the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> (either <hi>Cyrus, Darius</hi> or <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> for the reſtoring and building againe of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> But more likely it is, that this out going of the word, ſhould be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from the executing of the word or Decree for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and building of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> that is (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe fignifyeth) for the building againe of <hi>Ieruſalem. Cyrus</hi> made ſuch a decree; in which, though
<note n="*" place="margin">Ezr. 1.2, 3, 4. and Chro. 36.22, 23.</note> 
                           <hi>Ezra</hi> mentions only the Temple, as the chiefe part of the City: yet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſheweth, that even the building of the City was included; as is plain by what is written in the four and fortyeth Chapter of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, at the 28 verſe; and in the Chapter next after, at the 13 verſe. <hi>Darius</hi> ſeconded this, when after <hi>Cyrus</hi> his time, the building was hindred, making the foreſaid decree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the ground of his favour and aſſiſtance. After which <hi>Ezra</hi> comes up, and by vertue of a commiſſion granted to him from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes Longimanus</hi> (in the ſeventh yeare of his reigne) doth much good,
<note place="margin">Ezr. chap. 6. Ezr. chap. 7.</note> and goeth fairely on in repairing the deſolations and wall (as is mentioned <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.9.) but could not effect the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115738:70"/>whole buſineſſe: for the Adverſaries of the <hi>Iewes</hi> prevailed ſtill againſt them. And therefore 13 yeares after all this, news is brought to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> at <hi>Shuſhan</hi> by <hi>Hanani</hi> and certain men of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that the <hi>Iewes</hi> were ſtill in great affliction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: for the wall of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was broken down,
<note place="margin">Neh. 1.2.3.4.</note> and the gates thereof burnt with fire. At the hearing whereof <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> ſat down &amp; wept, and mourned certaine dayes, and prayed before the God of heaven. After which prayer, becauſe he was the Kings Cup-bearer, he was to attend upon his place:
<note place="margin">Neh. 2.5.6. &amp;c.</note> and being obſerved to looke heavie and ſad in the preſence of the King, the King demanded the reaſon; which he told him: and thereupon obtained leave and authority with letters of Commiſſion from him to go up unto <hi>Iudah</hi> (the City of his fathers Sepulchers) that he might build it; as may be ſeen in the firſt and ſecond Chapters of <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> This was in the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> afore mentioned: at which time <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came up and prevailed ſo farre againſt the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that the worke went on, and a tythe was taken out of other Cities to come and dwell at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the building whereof was never after hindred any more but by the end of the Seven Weekes (mentioned afterwards) was brought to perfection.</p>
                        <p>And hereto agreeth <hi>Petavius</hi> ſaying; <hi>Exitus ſermonis non E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicti ſolùm pronounciatio eſt, ſed executio,</hi> lib. 12. <hi>De Doctr. Temp.</hi> cap. 35. And in the ſame book, at the 32 Chapter, ſpeaking firſt of the common acceptation of the word, and ſhewing how thereby the beginning of theſe Weeks is drawne to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, by reaſon of ſeverall goings forth of the Word, he concludeth and ſaith; <hi>At ego vocabulum</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>non ſolam arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tror edicti promulgationem, ſed amplius aliquid eſſe: nempe id quod Latina vox proprie ſignificat, veram ac ſeriam decreti illius execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, &amp;c.</hi> Meaning, That that which we commonly read from the going forth of the Word, is of larger extent then ſo; and doth therefore ſtand to expreſſe that which the Latine word <hi>Exitus</hi> properly ſignifyeth, <hi>viz.</hi> A true and ſerious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Decree for the building againe of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And thus doe I alſo underſtand it; onely with this difference:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115738:71"/>By the Decree I underſtand that which was firſt ſet forth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> for though it was ſeconded once and again, yet not fully executed till the dayes of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as I have already ſhewed.</p>
                        <p>Or however, be the reading according to the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, yet it muſt be with reference to the building a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the Originall intendeth: and ſo we are ſtill directed to the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> when <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> came up and built (not the Temple, but) the City for which he petitioned, even the City of his Fathers Sepulchers, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.5. And for this the King ſent letters to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors beyond the River, and a letter to <hi>Aſaph</hi> the keeper of the Kings Forreſt: in which the word may very well be ſaid to goe forth for the building againe of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that both wayes we are directed to one and the ſame time for the beginning of theſe Weeks.</p>
                        <p>But for my part I like beſt of the firſt expoſition. For (as is obſerved by others, as well as <hi>Petavius</hi>) it is <hi>genuina interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio,</hi> a genuine interpretation: <hi>nempe ut dicamus ex quo tempore res illa, quam Deus per Propehtas ſuos praedixerat, &amp; quam Reges Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarum Edictis ſanciverant, effecta eſt reddita, remotis omnibusremoris.</hi> So that <hi>Ab Exitu Verbi,</hi> is as much as <hi>Ex quo Verbum prodiit; id eſt, in effectum producta eſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus much for the Out-going of the Word, by which we are taught where to begin the firſt year of <hi>Daniels</hi> Weekes.</p>
                        <p>[To returne and build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>] that is, To build againe <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> for ſo the Hebrew phraſe ſignifieth. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: <hi>Iſaac</hi> returned and digged the wels of water, which they had digged in the dayes of <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father: for the Philiſtines had ſtopped them after the death of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 26.18. By which is meant, that he digged them againe. <hi>Rurſus fodit:</hi> ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Hierom.</hi> To which the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> well agreeth: and is therefore tranſlated in our Bibles, <hi>Iſaac</hi> digged againe.</p>
                        <p>So alſo in the fixt Chapter of <hi>Zachary,</hi> at the firſt verſe: I returned and lifted up mine eyes and ſaw; That is, Lifting up
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115738:71"/>mine eyes I ſaw againe, as <hi>Tremelius</hi> tranſlates the place.</p>
                        <p>So alſo in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Malachie,</hi> at the fourth verſe, We will returne and build the deſolate places: that is, We will build againe the deſolate places. And ſo here. To return and build <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is as much as to ſay, To build againe <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> and is therefore ſo interpreted by Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> in his Comment upon the place. Which being well obſerved, will diſcover the groſſe miſtake of thoſe <hi>Expoſitors,,</hi> who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Angel ſpeakes here concerning the returne of the people out of the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that therefore the 70 Weekes muſt begin in the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But beſide their miſtake of the Hebrew phraſe, the very time from thence to Chriſt will be againſt them.</p>
                        <p>For ſhould the Weekes begin at the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Monarchy,
<note place="margin">The Weekes begin not in the firſt yeare of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                           </note> they would be ended long before Chriſt was born: but that may not be; for they muſt reach full three years and a halfe beyond his Paſſion; as is plainly manifeſt by the verſes following.</p>
                        <p>But to help this, ſome are bold to cut off at one blow no leſſe then near a hundred years from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mornarchy, as if they had traiterouſly crept into the Chronology of thoſe times: an eaſie way to make their accounts even, but no ſure ſtay for truth to reſt upon.</p>
                        <p>I know and have ſeen their choyceſt arguments to uphold this tottring building, but by diligent ſearch have found themfrivolous, there being nothing either in <hi>Beroaldus, Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, More,</hi> or others of them, but may be eaſily anſwered. But I liſt not to trifle away much time about them: Onely in few words I ſhall ſay not onely that the full current of Authours doe begin the reigne of <hi>Cyrus</hi> over <hi>Perſia</hi> in the 55 <hi>Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> but even <hi>Thucidides</hi> (who wrot of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, ſaw it from the beginning to the end, was an <hi>Athenian</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Captaine in it, and Authour for certaine truth of Hiſtory, and perfect reekoning of times moſt excellent: whoſe Workes <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> the famous Orator of <hi>Athenes</hi> Copyed out with his owne hands no leſſe then eight times, as <hi>Lucian</hi> reporteth) he I ſay reckoneth from the <hi>Marathon</hi> fight in the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115738:72"/>latter end of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis</hi> his reigne, to the end of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſian</hi> War 85 years: that is to ſay, ten to the invading of Greece be <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and 50 thence incluſively to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, with 27 more to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Now, that we may know how to place theſe in their right times, <hi>Xenophon</hi> (being the next after <hi>Thucidides</hi>) hath taught us that the four and twentieth year of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War muſt be joyned with the firſt year of the 93 <hi>Olympiad.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it muſt needs follow that the firſtyear of this War began in the end of the firſt year of the 87 <hi>Olympiad:</hi> and the War of <hi>Xerxes</hi> in the firſt year of the 75 <hi>Olympiad:</hi> and the fight at <hi>Marathon</hi> in the end of the ſecond year of the 72 <hi>Olympiad.</hi> Nor doth <hi>Thucidides</hi> but tell us as much;
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Thucid. lib.</hi> 2.</note> For as he declareth, the beginning of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War was in the fifteenth year of that League which after the taking of the Iland of <hi>Eubaea</hi> was made for 30 years to come, <hi>Aeneſias</hi> being then Major of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Pythodorus</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> the year of their Majorality now within two moneths expired, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spring.

                        </p>
                        <p>Men then I ſee may cavill without cauſe, and make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance in the Chronology of theſe times, but not prevaile in what they ſtrive for; no not with all the helpe <hi>Beroaldus</hi> and Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> can afford them. To which let me add, how groſly they have been miſtaken, not well obſerving how childiſhly they have ſhrunck the ſucceſſions of ſundry Lives. For when it is ſaid that one man lived in ſuch and ſuch a mans dayes, they preſently and raſhly take their years and ages to be equall: which is in effect as if they ſhould deny that ayoung man might not live in an old mans time, or that a grave Philoſoper might not have a young Pupill, or that an aged Father might not ſometimes beget a ſon in the time of his age, or that it was incredible to grant an hundred years for any man to live. All which are but poore ſhifts, little or nothing to the purpoſe, although at the firſt ſight ſome perhaps may highly prize them.</p>
                        <p>And ſo alſo for <hi>Olympiads; Broughton</hi> I confeſſe hath gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115738:73"/>together many ſcattered fragments, cheifly out of <hi>Suidas,</hi> by which he thinks to overthrow the credit of <hi>Olympiads,</hi> and caſt the hand-maide out of fervice. But I anſwer, one Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is not enough to proclame a Summer; nor be things done without care, able to prevaile againſt the truth. <hi>Suidas</hi> in this deſerves no better credit, unleſſe we account him an expert Archer who kils a Crow by chance. In a word, moſt of his numbers were negligently corrupted, or were at the firſt not carefully gathered. And ſo alſo may we ſay of other Authours, who write of ſuch things as theſe are, onely by the way, and not on purpoſe: Neither have ſome but oftentimes miſtaken <hi>Suidas,</hi> taking his meaning in a wrong ſence; cheifly when things are thought to be contemporary, which indeed are very far aſunder: or if at all contemporary, but onely in part; as I have already ſhewed. And further, for <hi>Olympiads,</hi> that which hath cauſed others to deliver wrong collections from them, was becauſe they did not follow the common courſe which was moſt uſuall in that kinde of reckoning: for whilſt from the beginning of ſundry Games, they had a Series or order of ſundry years, the fiftieth from one thing might be the 25th from another thing. And ſo <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there were at the leaſt a dozen ſeverall Games, and Game-rulers accordingly, ſet up at ſeverall times far diſtant the one from the other: which not well regarded might make a confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> amongſt careleſſe Authours. The truth therefore is, That that account which was moſt common, was leaſt faulty: for it had but one head from whence to reckon, &amp; was ſet forth in Tables by <hi>Hyppias</hi> of <hi>Elis,</hi> received alſo generally in Computations; yea even by <hi>Plutarch</hi> hims ſelfe, although in the Life of <hi>Numa</hi> he moved ſome ſcruple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: in which he ſeemed to ſavour of an uſuall cuſtome of the Academicall Sect, which was alwayes ready furniſhed to diſpute on either ſide, either <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>contra,</hi> either for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth.</p>
                        <p>I grant indeed that the ancienteſt of Antiquities among humane Authours cannot but be full of errour: but this was rather in the times before the <hi>Olympiads</hi> then afterwards, as

                           <hi>Marcus Varre</hi> a learned Roman well obſerveth; concluding the times after to be more certaine and Hiſtoricall, becauſe then the times began to be recorded <hi>veris teſtatiſque literarum Monumentis,</hi> as one rightly ſpeaketh.</p>
                        <p>Unto <hi>Varro</hi> agreed <hi>Julius Africanus,</hi> another ancient

                        <p>After whom <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> alſo ſaith, that after the firſt <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad</hi> there never was any great diſſention or controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Writers for Computation of time; except in ſome ſix or ſeven years at the moſt. Or if in ſome particular the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence perhaps might be ſomething more, yet by comparing Authour with Authour, and circumſtance with circumſtance, I cannot but think that men of judgement may not onely correct corrupted Copies, but even reconcile the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall diſagreements, or at the leaſt ſhew how and wherein an Authour ſometimes hath been miſtaken.</p>
                        <p>In a word, this reckoning by <hi>Olympiads</hi> hath been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, followed, and commended by even the very flower and cheife of the ancient Fathers; as by <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Origen, Julius Africanus</hi> aforementioned, <hi>Fuſebius, Hierom, Auguſtine, Oroſius,</hi> and others both pious and learned Chriſtians.

As for example: <hi>Joſiah</hi> is ſaid to be the father of <hi>Iechoniah, Matth.</hi> 1.11. whereas the father of <hi>Ieconiah</hi> was <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.8. So alſo <hi>Zedekiah</hi> is called in

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115738:75"/>the ſon of <hi>Ieconiah,</hi> becauſe he reigned next after him; and yet we know, that by propriety of ſpeech he was his uncle, as may be ſeen in 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 24.17. So alſo <hi>Salathiel</hi> is called the ſon of <hi>Iechoniah, Mat.</hi> 1.12. and yet not only did <hi>Ieconiah</hi> dye child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.30. but alſo <hi>Salathiel</hi> was indeed the ſon of <hi>Aſſir,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.17.

<note n="*" place="margin">Ezra 5.2. &amp; Mat. 1.12.</note> ſon of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathiel, Matth.</hi> 1.12. whereas he was not his immediate ſon: for <hi>Zorobabel</hi> was indeed the ſon of <hi>Pedaiah,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.19.

And therefore though <hi>Ezra</hi> were ſo near kindred to that ſtock, yet it might be in a collaterall line by ſome that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from <hi>Seraiah,</hi> and yet nevertheleſſe be reckoned in Genealogy as if he were his ſon; according to that before mentioned of <hi>Salathiel,</hi> called the ſon of <hi>Ieconiah;</hi> or that of <hi>Zedechia,</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.16.

                           </label> That that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> who was in the beginning of this Monarchy, was not the ſame who lived ſomething towards the end of it, nor ever was ſent to build
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115738:76"/>the Wals of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> For [firſt] that <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> who was in the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> returned home at the end of the Captivity, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.2. <hi>Neh.</hi> 7.7. Whereas this, who was ſervant to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> went not home till the Wals of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> were to be built, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.5.8. Secondly, it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing among the Jews to call more then one by the ſame name; as is evident almoſt in every Catalogue where Catalogues are recorded. As for example: In <hi>Neh.</hi> 12.1. there is an <hi>Ezra</hi> who returned with <hi>Zorobabel;</hi> and in <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.1. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother who came not up untill the dayes of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> Alſo, in <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.2. and <hi>Neh.</hi> 7.7. there is a <hi>Mordecai</hi> who returned in the firſt of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and in <hi>Eſther</hi> 2.5. another who lived at <hi>Shuſhan</hi> and nouriſhed <hi>Eſther:</hi> For if <hi>Eſthers Mordecai</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> he would not have dwelt at <hi>Shuſhan</hi> and trained up <hi>Eſther</hi> among the Heathen but rather in the Holy Land among the people of God. Alſo, See the firſt book of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the Catalogues in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and then amongſt the multitude of perſons, many are known by one name. A <hi>Jeremiah</hi> which (even <hi>Speed</hi> himſelfe will ſay) was not <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.2. A <hi>Daniel</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, though not the ſame who was caſt into the Den of Lyons, <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.6. A <hi>Seraiah</hi> alſo, though not the ſame who was ſlaine by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Ezra</hi> 2.2. And in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> chap. 6. two <hi>Abitubs,</hi> two <hi>Zadockes,</hi> and three <hi>Azariabs</hi> in one line.</p>
                        <p>And ſo alſo for <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> he who came up in the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> was not <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the famous, but another of the ſame name. For I finde three <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> in the Hiſtory of theſe times: One, mentioned <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.2. <hi>Neh.</hi> 7.7. Another who returned in the twentieth year of <hi>Artaxerxes, Nehemiah, cap.</hi> 1. and <hi>cap.</hi> 2. And a third differing from all theſe. <hi>Nehe.</hi> 3.16. For <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the great was <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the ſone of <hi>Hachaliah;</hi> but this other was <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Azbuck,</hi> the Ruler of the halfe part of <hi>Beth-zur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So then <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was not in the beginning of this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie. And as not in the beginning, ſo neither in the end of it he was indeed in the dayes of <hi>Darius:</hi> but this was not the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115738:76"/>laſt <hi>Darius,</hi> as is commonly ſuppoſed. It was rather that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> who reigned next after <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> as by the courſe of the Hiſtory appeareth, and is ſo underſtood by <hi>Lydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, Cluverus, Conradus, Pawell</hi> and others.</p>
                        <p>But this you will ſay cannot be, in regard that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was in the dayes of the High prieſt <hi>Jaduah,</hi> who (as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> writeth) met and appeaſed mighty <hi>Alexander</hi> comming againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the year before he conquered <hi>Darius Codoman,</hi> the laſt King of this Monarchie.</p>
                        <p>To which <hi>Petavius</hi> anſwereth,
<note place="margin">Petavil. lib. 12. cap 25.</note> that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> indeed recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Prieſts and Levites ſo as his times; and then ſome one or other, comming after him, put in that of <hi>Iaduah</hi> and the laſt <hi>Darius.</hi> The like where of is to be found in other Bookes of Scripture; as in the end of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> where thoſe things that concerne the death of <hi>Moſes</hi> were written by ſome other. So alſo in the end of the Bookes of <hi>Ioſhua, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> ſome things are added which were not of the Authours putting in.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115738:77"/>from that which he preſently ſubjoyneth in the ſame Chap. v. 23. namely, That the Prieſts were written to the times of <hi>Iohanan</hi> the chiefe Prieſt. But he was not under the laſt <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> it was his ſonne <hi>Iaduah,</hi> whom <hi>Nehemiah</hi> might ſee being a child, but not a chiefe Prieſt: neither doth he ſay he did.</p>
                        <p>So then, though <hi>Nehemiah</hi> might, and did, come low in the times of this Monarchie, yet not to the end of it by farre. For beſide all this, <hi>Iaduah</hi> began to be in the Prieſts office 32 years at the leaſt, before the laſt year of the laſt <hi>Darius,</hi> although he entred thereon but at the death of <hi>Mnemon;</hi> whereas no man can tell but he might be in the Prieſthood ſome years before: and ſo, not only be old when he met <hi>Alexander,</hi> but alſo be ſo high in the <hi>Perſian</hi> times, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> might record him heire of the Prieſthood. At which time though it were when <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> was old, yet is not this granted without warrant: For, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> lived till he was laden with age, <hi>Joſephus</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in his Antiquities, at the end of the fifth Chapter of the eleventh booke.</p>
                        <p>But I do ill, you will ſay, to mention <hi>Joſephus:</hi> for by him <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (being of equall time with <hi>Sanballat</hi>) muſt be as low as the dayes of the laſt <hi>Darius.</hi>

For in <hi>Joſephus, Manaſſes</hi> who was then the ſon in law to <hi>Sanballat,</hi> and caſt out by a tumult of the people through the aſſiſtance of the high prieſt <hi>Jaduah,</hi> was the brother of <hi>Jaduah.</hi> But he whom <hi>Nehemiah</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, was not the brother of <hi>Jaduah,</hi> but the brother of the father of <hi>Jaduah;</hi> and not caſt out by the people aſſiſted by the chiefe prieſt, but caſt out by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> himſelfe, as is manifeſt in <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.28.</p>
                        <p>It can therefore be no abſurdity to grant there were two <hi>Sanballats;</hi> the one in the dayes of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the other in the dayes of the laſt <hi>Darius,</hi> and of <hi>Alexander magnus:</hi> which

                           <hi>Vnto Meſſiah the Prince</hi>] This is meant of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our Lord; as may be ſeen <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.41. For this is to be noted, that the word <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is never uſed for an Adjective being ſet before the Subſtantive, as here MESSIAH NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GID, <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the Prince. And therefore doth here mean no other then <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, CHRIST THE LORD, as the Angel ſtiles him, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.11. and is for certaine a proper name in this text belonging unto him who is the Saviour of the world: who after ſeven weekes and threeſcore and two weekes was crucifyed upon the Croſſe, even in the laſt weeke of the Seventy. And note likewiſe, that when in other texts, it is attributed to other perſons, it is then after another manner, having a Pronounce affixed, or a Subſtantive of the Genitive caſe: as, <hi>Mine annointed, Thine annointed, The annointed of God, his annointed,</hi> or <hi>The Prieſt</hi> which <hi>is annointed.</hi> But here is no ſuch thing: and therefore muſt upon neceſſity meane CHRIT JESUS <hi>our Lord,</hi> and no other. Which even <hi>Rabbi Judah</hi> confeſſeth, in his Comment upon <hi>Daniel:</hi> alleadging thereupon that ſaying of the prophet, in <hi>Eſa</hi> 55.4. <hi>Behold I have given him for a witneſſe to the people, a Prince and a Commander of the Nations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Seven weekes, and threeſcore and two weekes</hi>] Theſe put together do make 69. weekes, or 483. years; whoſe preciſe end was at the beginning of Chriſts Miniſtery: for then did Chriſt Jeſus our <hi>Saviour [Meſſiah the Prince]</hi> openly manifeſt himſelf, being annointed to that office a little before when he was baptized by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi> &amp; proclaimed then by a voice from Heaven to be the ſon of God. Both which fell into the yeare of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4742. the one on the ſixth of <hi>January,</hi> when he was baptized; the other, on the third of <hi>October,</hi> when he began his Miniſtery, 483. yeares from the beginning of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115738:78"/>weekes. For in 69 weekes, are 69 ſevens of yeares: and they put together do make 483. yeares.</p>
                        <p>If it be objected, that the <hi>Medea distinctio,</hi> or the Hebrew point <hi>Athnah,</hi> ſtanding in the originall next after <hi>Seven weekes,</hi> are againſt this interpretation; my anſwer then is: that though there be indeed ſuch a diſtinction or point there, yet the ſence is not therefore to be ſuſpended at <hi>Seven weekes,</hi> as if they might not together with the 62 make one whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 69. For in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> at the firſt verſe, thewords and the points ſtand thus. <hi>In the beginning God: crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Heavens and the Earth.</hi> And yet there <hi>Athnah</hi> hath not ſo much as the force of a <hi>Comma.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It would therefore be obſerved, that the holy <hi>Hebrew</hi> (as one ſaith) hath 19 Kingly accents, and eleven Servants: The Kings ſtay many times on the chiefe word or number in the ſentence, whilſt the ſervants haſten on.

This firſt part thereof is for that which was done firſt: and becauſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is farre leſſe then ſixty two, it is called after a Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and obſcure phraſe, <hi>Aſtreight of times.</hi> In which firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall moſt like it is that the City was fully finiſhed and ſet in order: That is, both publike and private works and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; as houſes, ſtreets and wayes, ſubſtituting of right Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, with other things of the like kind. With which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation the interlinearie Gloſſe agreeth, as <hi>Petavius</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
                        <p>Verſe 26. <hi>And after</hi> 62 <hi>weekes Meſſiah ſhall be ſlaine</hi>] That is, Sixty and two weekes after the Seven: for when the Seven weekes were ended, then were the 62. to take beginning, and the one weeke next after them for the confirming of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. In which one weeke it was that the <hi>Meſſiiah</hi> was ſlain:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115738:78"/>for as the Angel here ſheweth, it was after ſeven and ſixty two; and therefore in the ſeventieth or laſt Week of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty. And why I ſay, after ſeven and ſixty two, is becauſe of the diviſion: firſt ſeven, then ſixty two. Which is all one with after ſixty two, accounted from the end of the ſeven: for ſo without doubt the Angel meaneth. To which purpoſe <hi>Lansbergius</hi> noteth, ſaying: <hi>Non putat Angelus ſexaginta duas Septimanas à principio ſeptimanae primae, ſed à fine Septimae: ut ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſit, Chriſtum moriturum eſſe Septimana Septuageſima.</hi> That is, The Angel accounteth not the ſixty and two Weekes from the beginning of the firſt Week, but from the end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth: ſo that the ſenſe is, Chriſt was to dye in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Weeke. But in what year of that Weeke, is ſhewed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Shall be ſlain</hi>] The word in the Originall is <hi>Carath,</hi> which ſignifyeth <hi>to cut</hi> off either by baniſhment, or death. In the firſt ſenſe Chriſt was <hi>cut</hi> off when the Jews ſaid, We have no other King but <hi>Caeſar, Joh.</hi> 19.15. and in the other ſenſe he was <hi>cut</hi> off, when after their loud cryes of crucifie him, crucifie him, they put him to death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But not for himſelfe</hi>] This is likewiſe true of Chriſt, as the Prophet ſheweth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.4, 5, 6. But whether it be the right reading of this place, ſome make queſtion: and doe therefore render the words thus: <hi>And there ſhall not be unto him</hi>] that is, He ſhall not be; or not have any being, but be extinct and gone. Meaning, that being ſlain or cut off by death, he ſhould have no longer being among the living: and ſo alſo <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, He was cut off out of the Land of the living, for the tranſgreſſion of my people was the ſtroke upon him, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.8. All which was certainly fulfilled when Chriſt taſting death was not onely buried, but by his enemies ſhut in the Sepulcher, leaſt he ſhould againe be ſeene in the Land of the living.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And the people of the Prince to come, ſhall deſtroy the City and the Sanctuary</hi>] This is meant of the Romans under the Conduct of <hi>Titus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> by whom the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple were deſtroyed: which is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115738:79"/>here foretold as a judgement to come upon the Jews for their putting Chriſt to death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And the end thereof ſhall be with a Flood</hi>] Meaning, that the Romane Army ſhould be unto them as the overflowing of Waters in a Flood: and ſhould therefore prevaile againſt all the force that the forſaken Jews could make againſt them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And unto the end of the War deſolations are determined</hi>] By which is meant, that ſo long as the War continued, ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but deſolations and deſtructions. Which accordingly came to paſſe, faſt one upon another: firſt in one place, then in another, till all was waſted; as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> hath at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, in his ſeventh book of the Jews War, at the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; in his ſixt book at the firſt chapter likewiſe; as alſo in ſome other places of his writings. Whoſe relations doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently agree with the word deſolations in the plurall number, here foretold by the Angel in the words of this prophecy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ver.</hi> 27. <hi>One Weeke</hi>] This is the laſt week of the ſeventy: in which the Angel ſheweth, that though the Jewiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be caſt off, and their City and Temple deſtroyed; yet nevertheleſſe the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould for one whole Week Offer himſelfe unto them, and gather many of them into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Goſpel. This Week was therefore wholly ſpent in preaching to thoſe of the <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part whereof Chriſt himſelfe in his own perſon preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and in the latter part he alſo preached unto them by his Apoſtles, who went not unto the Gentiles till this Week was ended. For as the 70 Weekes were cut out over the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and over the holy City, but not over the Gentiles: ſo alſo the confirming of the Covenant by Chriſt in this laſt Week of the 70, was cut out over the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and over the holy City, but not over the Gentiles. And that not without cauſe: For though Chriſt by his death redeemed as well the Gentiles as the Jews, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.52. yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was in the firſt place promiſed to the Jewiſh Nation, and after a peculiar manner their Saviour, it was conſentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that in the firſt place he ſhould offer Salvation unto them,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115738:79"/>and confirm his Covenant with many of them, before he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Goſpell to be ſpread abroad, and to take place among the Gentiles. This appeareth by that Caveat w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> in this Week he gave to his Apoſtles, when they had their firſt power to preach; namely, that they ſhould not turn into the way of the Gentiles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5. It appeareth alſo by that which himſelfe ſaid to the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> That he was not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, Math.</hi> 15.24. And as they had this Caveat, ſo they heeded it very carefully, even after his death and Paſſion: inſomuch that <hi>Peter</hi> abſtained from preaching to any but the Jews, untill he was taught by Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Gentiles alſo pertained to the ſociety of the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.1. In a word, <hi>Paul</hi> was converted about ſix moneths after the Paſſion of Chriſt; three years after which, he returned to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that he might ſee <hi>Peter:</hi> from whence (after he had ſtayed 15 dayes) he went into the regions of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and preached there to the Gentiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. By which it appeareth, that it was full three years and an half after Chriſt's Paſſion before they began to preach to any but the Jews: and at that time this One Weeke was ended. For (as it followeth) Chriſts death was in the middle of this very Week.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And in the midſt of the Weeke he ſhall cauſe Sacrifice and Oblation to ceaſe</hi>] This was certainly done by Chriſts death. For in the former verſe it was ſaid, <hi>That after threeſcore and two Weeks</hi> Meſſiah <hi>ſhould be ſlain:</hi> and now in this verſe is ſhewed the very preciſe time of his death, <hi>viz. That it was in the middle of this Weeke: for then was Chriſt to cauſe the Sacrifices and Oblations to ceaſe.</hi> Yea, all the Sacrifices of the old Teſtament, and the whole Legall and Typicall ſervice was then at an end, by that one Oblation of Chriſt upon the Croſſe: for nothing but the death of Chriſt was of efficacie to aboliſh the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Legall figures, which were but figures of him and of his Sacrifice; as may be ſeen by that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> in the ninth and tenth Chapters. He taketh away the firſt, that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond; ſaith the Apoſtle there, Chap. 10. verſe 9. Not that the Jewiſh
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115738:80"/>Sacrifices did actually then ceaſe:
<note place="margin">Peta <hi>De Doct. Temp.</hi> lib. 12. cap. 35.</note> but that they were <hi>de jure,</hi> or in very deed and truth then aboliſhed, as <hi>Petavius</hi> noteth. Which alſo not onely the laſt voyce of Chriſts dying, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, It is finiſhed, but even the vaile of the Temple being rent in twaine, from the top to the bottome, declared, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.51. For by that Symbol Chriſt witneſſed that he by his death aboliſhed all the Sacrifices, and all the legall worſhip. For (as <hi>Lansbergius</hi> well obſerveth) ſo long as that Shadowie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Jews remained,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Lansberg.</hi> in his Chronol. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> the vaile was between in the earthly Sanctuary: but the vaile being rent, the legall Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were abrogated, and all uſe of the old Covenant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and a paſſage opened for us to the Heavenly Sanctuary. But it followeth,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And by a Wing of Abominations making deſolate, he ſhall flow upon the deſolate</hi>] Here againe after ſpeech of the death of Chriſt is ſubjoyned a threatning againſt the Jews for putting him to death. For by this <hi>Wing of Abominations,</hi> is meant the Army of the Romans: and that (as will appeare) very ſignificant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the word in the Original here tranſlated <hi>Wing,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from a verbe (but once found in the Hebrew Scripture) which ſignifies according to the <hi>Chaldee,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> in his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Daniels</hi> Weeks <hi>pa.</hi> 41.</note> To gather together: ſo alſo in the <hi>Arabick:</hi> in which it ſignifieth alſo, To envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron or compaſſe about; as is gallantly obſerved by one upon the place.

By which he doth for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain meane the Army of the Romans, called here an Army of Abominations, or a people of Abominations; That is, of Gentles and worſhippers of Idols: as is manifeſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the Scripture often not onely calleth Idols by the name of <hi>Abominations;</hi> but uſeth alſo to expreſſe and imply
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115738:80"/>under the names of the Gods, the Nations themſelves that worſhipped them. Thus <hi>Aſhtaroth</hi> is called the Abomination of the <hi>Sidonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 23.13. And in another place, The ſtrangers with whom the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had contracted affinity, are called expreſly the people of Abominations, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.14. So here, The Army which the Angel foretold ſhould come againſt <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is called a <hi>Wing</hi> (or an Army) of a people of Abominations: by which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould flow upon the Deſolate; That is, upon the deſolate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Jews. For in this ſervice (though an Army of Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations) it was the Army of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> as in a fit Parable, ayming at this Prophecy, our Saviour telleth us, <hi>Matthew</hi> 22.7.</p>

                        <p>And thus I have now expounded this ſacred Prophecy of <hi>Daniels</hi> LXX Weekes, then which there is no one Prophecy in all the whole Bible that doth more convince the Jew, nor better confirme the Chriſtian for the comming of Chriſt. For when the Angel had divided the Weekes into ſeven and ſixty two, which were to end at <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the Prince, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in the next verſe he addeth, ſaying, And after 62 Weekes <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall be ſlain: joyning hereunto the <hi>One Week</hi> remaining; In the middle whereof the Sacrifice and Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to ceaſe; that is to be aboliſhed or made void and of none effect by his death and Paſſion. <hi>Quare poſt ſexaginta novem abſolutas, in Septuageſima utique, ac poſtrema, Chriſtus occidendus erat;</hi> as ſaith <hi>Petavius.</hi> Who hereupon concludeth, that they doe in vaine ſeek the end of theſe Weekes who look for it ſo low as the deſtruction of the City by the Romans.

                           </label> That they be indeed determined or cut out over the people and over the holy City; but it was to finiſh tranſgreſſion and to make an end of Sinne, to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for iniquity, to bring in everlaſting righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſeale up viſion and Prophet, and to annoint the moſt Holy. All which have manifeſt relation to that which Chriſt did in or near the laſt week of the 70: For near the beginning of that week Jeſus Chriſt (that Holy of holies) was annointed with the holy Ghoſt <hi>in populi ſui Redemptorem,</hi> for a Redeemer of his people. For although Chriſt alwayes had the Spirit, yet for all that there was to be a kind of ſolemne annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to undertake that Office, witneſſed by the Prophet <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61.1. and performed accordingly at his Baptiſme when the laſt weeke was ready to begin: For then the holy Ghoſt came downe upon him in the likeneſſe of a Dove, the Heavens being alſo opened, and a voice from the Father ſaying, <hi>This is my welbeloved ſonne in whom I am well pleaſed, Matth,</hi> 3.16.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.22. After which inauguration, at the beginning of the laſt weeke, he entred on his Miniſtry, and began to preach de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to the Captives: and in the middle of the weeke ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for us on the Croſſe, and by his death made an end of ſinne, freeing us from it and putting it away by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himſelfe: as was before proved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26</p>
                        <p>All therefore that ſhall need to be now obſerved further, is the method of the Angel in the verſe objected; ſpeaking of that laſt which was done firſt, and of that firſt which was done laſt: which if <hi>Calviſius</hi> had well obſerved, he needed not have urged the annointing of the Moſt holy againſt the right ending of theſe weekes.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps it will be ſtill objected out of the 26 and 27 verſes,

                        <p>To which I anſwer, that although the deſtruction of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty be there mentioned, yet not becauſe it was within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the weekes, or becauſe the end of them muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thither, but becauſe the deſtruction of the City was to follow and fall upon the <hi>Jewes</hi> as a puniſhment for their putting Chriſt to death; as in the Annotations foregoing hath been ſhewed. It was ſpoken of to ſhew the hainouſneſſe of that ſin, and is foreſhewed to follow as a juſt judgement of God for ſo great a wickedneſſe, and not becauſe it is to be included within the compaſſe of the weekes. And of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the Abomination of Deſolation was but a ſigne, ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet: thats all; and more then that cannot be juſtly gathered from the places objected.</p>
                        <p>But they further urge,

                           </label> that though the ſinne of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was the cauſe of their puniſhment; yea, and among other ſinnes, that of putting Chriſt to death: yet did not <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> utterly ceaſe to be a City or Church of God till they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and blaſpemed the Apoſtolicall Miniſtery, by perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill in their wickedneſſe. For when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and crucified Chriſt, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> inſpired by the holy Ghoſt ſaith ſtill, To you belong the Promiſes, and to your children, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39.</p>
                        <p>True,
<label type="milestone">

                           </label> I grant as much: for after Chriſts Paſſion there were ſtill three years and an halfe before the 70 Weekes were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And till then there was no tender of Salvation to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> For in the laſt Week, Chriſt firſt by himſelfe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by his Apoſtles preached to the Jews; confirming a Covenant with many of them during the time of that Week: which being ended, the Apoſtles turne to the Gentiles, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready I have moſt fully and plainly proved.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps it will be objected out of <hi>Beroaldus,</hi>
                           <label type="milestone">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115738:82"/>were cut out over the people and the Holy City.</p>
                        <p>To which is anſwered, though the word indeed is uſed as well for <hi>Halfe</hi> as <hi>Middle;</hi> yet here it muſt be rendred <hi>Middle</hi> and not <hi>Halfe.</hi> For even in the text it ſelfe, Chriſt is ſaid to cauſe to ceaſe, or to aboliſh Sacrifice and Oblation. Now this action is not <hi>Actio manens</hi> and <hi>continuata,</hi> but <hi>cito tranſiens:</hi> for it is meant of the death of Chriſt, who put away ſin by the death or Sacrifice of himſelfe, aboliſhing legall offerings for ſin, to eſtabliſh his owne Sacrifice and Oblation once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon the Croſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. chap. 10.9. Unleſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will make Chriſts death to be a continued action, and ſay that he continued in that act of dying for the ſpace of three years and an halfe, we muſt needs grant (as the truth is) that he was crucified or ſlaine in the Middle of the Weeke: which the confirming of the Covenant doth fully prove.</p>
                        <p>But ſaith <hi>Funccius,</hi> the Sacrifices were of right aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when Chriſt was Baptized: in witneſſe whereof there came a voice from heaven ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved ſon in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3.17. <hi>Quaſi dicat: Nulla poſthac hoſtia, nullum Sacrificium Moſaicum mihi placebit.</hi> Which is as if it ſhould be ſaid, No offering, no Moſaicall Sacrifice ſhall henceforwards pleaſe me any more.</p>
                        <p>Whereunto is anſwered, that the Sacrifices of the Law did never pleaſe God otherwiſe then types and ſhadowes of Chriſts owne Sacrifice of himſelfe; and in that reſpect, <hi>Moſes</hi> his Sacrifices and ſuch types of Chriſt, were as well acceptable to God after his Baptiſme till his Paſſion, as before; which is plain by that in <hi>Matthew</hi> 8.3. where Chriſt after his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme bids the Leper offer the gift that <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded: which (among other things) was two <hi>Hee Lambes,</hi> and one <hi>Ewe Lamb;</hi> as is recorded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.10. So that ſtill I ſee the former expoſition will ſtand, notwithſtanding this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>But however, though their ending may be right, yet their beginning cannot, unleſſe they begin in the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For if the 70 weeks begin not in the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115738:83"/>of the 70 years of Captivity, and the ſeven times 70 years of liberty, cannot ſtand.</p>
                        <p>To which is anſwered,
<label type="milestone">

                           </label> that an analogie is a proportion, ſimilitude, or reſemblance which one thing hath unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now that any intervenient time can deſtroy an Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, is (as one truely ſaith) a meere Paradox. For it is certain, there was a true Analogie between the Paſchall Lamb in the firſt Paſſeover, and the Paſſion of Chriſt in the laſt Paſſeover, and yet we know that the one was many hundreds of years after the other.
<note place="margin">

<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat</hi> 12.40.</note> there alſo was a true analogie, but with many years again between. This objection therefore is no hindrance either to the length of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, or to the beginning of the 70 weeks, although they begin not juſt when 70 years of Captivity were ended.</p>
                        <p>I conclude therefore that the beginning of the LXX Weeks was in the twentieth year of <hi>Ataxerxes Longimanus,</hi> in the year of the Julian Period 4259, on the tenth of <hi>Tiſri</hi> which then was on the ſixth day of <hi>October,</hi> the ſun being then in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth degree of <hi>Libra:</hi> From whence to the beginning of Chriſts Miniſtery, in the year of the ſaid Period 4742. were 483 years which ended (not on the ſixth of <hi>October,</hi> but) on the third, becauſe the Sun was alſo then in the ſame point of heaven that he was at the firſt: which third of <hi>October</hi> was now the ſecond day of the Week, and ſeventh day of the ſeventh Moneth. After this was the middle of the laſt Week, on the third day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> in the year of the ſame Period 4746; for the third year of it ended on the third of <hi>October</hi> next before: from whence if we account 182 dayes (which make halfe a year) we ſhall come to the third of <hi>April</hi> &amp; juſt middle of this laſt Week; on which very day our Saviour ſuffered, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhall be more fully proved. And thus, having reſpect to the motion of the Sun, is this account ſo exact as I cannot but admire to find it ſo.</p>

                     <p>HAving finiſhed the proofes of the ſeverall Periods ſo far as is neceſſary, I come now to ſome other things perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent alſo to Chronologie. And firſt of the 70 years in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> commonly called the LXX years of <hi>Judah's</hi> Captivity, which ſome begin in the nineteenth year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> at the deſtruction of the City and Temple: becauſe then was not onely a deſolation of the Kingdome and People, but of the Fields and Grounds which were to lie deſolate untill the Land had enjoyed her Sabbaths: for as long as ſhe lay deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, ſhe kept Sabbath, to fulfill threeſcore and ten years; as is recorded in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.21.</p>
                     <p>But againſt this may be excepted, That they who reckon from hence, may as well account from a time which is foure years after. For if they ſtand upon it to prove that there muſt be a Deſolation, not onely of the People, but of the Fields and Ground; and that the Land was to lie deſolate and keep a Sabbath, free from all Inhabitants, for the full and compleate time of 70 years, and that thereupon the 70 years in <hi>Jeremy</hi> could not begin till ſuch a Deſolation: if ſo, then this (I ſay) muſt needs fall into the three and twentieth year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> becauſe the Land was not freed from all her Inhabitans till then, nor the Deſolations of <hi>Judah</hi> fully finiſhed untill that year, as may be ſeen in <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.30.</p>
                     <p>Nor ſecondly, doth that place (in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.21.) of keeping Sabbath 70 year, prove a continuall Sabbath of ſo long time: but rather ſheweth, that the Land during the years of her Deſolation, beginning from the abſence of her inhabitants, kept a Sabbath to fill up the number of 70 years. To fill up the number; that's all. The text therefore mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, as they would have, that no part of that number was begun till then: but that there ſhould not be any people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115738:84"/>in the Land, untill the whole number of 70 years, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly begun, ſhould be fully finiſhed: but where, or when they began, that text mentions not.</p>
                     <p>Others therefore reckon from the tranſmigration of <hi>Jecho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> in the eighth year of <hi>Nebuchannezzar:</hi> and they build cheifly upon two grounds. The one, becauſe the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> accounts from thence, calling the time after it, <hi>The time of our Captivity, Ezek.</hi> 40.1. The other is a proofe from the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who when he ſent an Epiſtle to thoſe who were carried away with <hi>Jechonia,</hi> telleth them plainly that when 70 years are accompliſhed at <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.10.</p>
                     <p>But here alſo may be excepted, Firſt, that the Prophets did uſually date their Prophecies from ſome remarkable accident or other: and therefore this Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with <hi>Jechonia,</hi> and had Viſions after he came to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> could doe no leſſe then date them from the time of that Captivity. For he not onely began to prophecy in the Land of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> after he was carried away thither: but alſo dated his Prophecies with reſpect to that time, and calleth it <hi>Our Captivity;</hi> becauſe it had relation to thoſe who were carried away at the ſame time when he was captivated. This is all: here therefore is no ſuch abſolute warrant for the beginning of the foreſaid ſeventy yeares, as ſome at the firſt may think.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, for that Epiſtle which was ſent to the Captives by <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> it is true indeed that they to whom he wrote were carried away with <hi>Iechonia;</hi> but for all that there is nothing in it to prove that the 70 years began but then. For the Prophet in the letter to them doth not ſay that they ſhould returne after they had acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed 70 years at <hi>Babylon:</hi> but (without defining any beginning or time from whence) after 70 years were accompliſhed. By which it appeareth plainly enough, that this alleaged cannot prove the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 70 years: for we ſee there is no neceſſity to begin the reckoning of them when that Epiſtle was ſent, but rather from the time when <hi>Iudah</hi> firſt began to be a ſtranger in her
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115738:84"/>owne Land, and to bewaile her caſe at <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was not begun in <hi>Iechonias,</hi> but in <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> with ſome other of the Kings ſeed, together with part of the Veſſels of the houſe of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.2. Which appeares further to be ſo, in regard that the whole time of <hi>Babels</hi> Kingdome was but 70 years, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 23.15. during which time, not onely the Jews, but the other neighbouring Nations were to ſerve the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Theſe Nations (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi>) ſhall ſerve the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> 70 years: and when ſeventy years are fulfilled, I will make the Land of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> a perpetuall deſolation, <hi>Ier.</hi> 25.11.12. And againe, They ſhall ſerve him, and his ſons, and his ſons ſon, <hi>Ier.</hi> 27.7. Which time among theſe, that it was but 70 years, is cleare by that before; mentioning, not onely how long the Nations were to ſerve the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but alſo how long that Kingdome was to ſtand. <hi>Eſay</hi> therefore ſaith, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that</hi> Tyre <hi>ſhall be forgotten ſeventy years, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the days of one King, Eſa.</hi> 23.15. Which expreſſion <hi>[According to the dayes of one King]</hi> is meant of one Kingdome, as appeareth by a like phraſe in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.17.23. And this one Kingdom was ſure enough the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> Kingdom, continued only to him, his ſon, &amp; his ſons ſon; as already hath been ſaid. Beſide, <hi>When</hi> 70 <hi>years are accompliſhed at</hi> Babylon, <hi>I will viſite you ſaith the Lord,</hi> in <hi>Ier,</hi> 29.10. And if when 70 years be accompliſhed at <hi>Babylon,</hi> then muſt the beginning be from the time of the Captivity of the firſt of the Jews that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> carried thither, even in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Kingdome. And when was this, but when God had given <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> into the hands of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> with part of the veſſels of the houſe of God? at which time not onely was <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> bound in fetters to be carryed to <hi>Babylon,</hi> but <hi>Daniel,</hi> with certaine more of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of the Kings ſeed, and of the Princes were brought thither by <hi>Aſhpenaz</hi> the maſter of the <hi>Eunuches,</hi> and taught there the learning and tongue of the <hi>Chaldeans, Daniel</hi> 1.3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth the ſame Prophet elſewhere but underſtand the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115738:85"/>beginning of theſe yeares thus: For I underſtood (ſaith he) by books the number of the yeares, whereof the word of the Lord came to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, that he would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh 70 yeares in the deſolations of <hi>Jeruſalem, Dan</hi> 9.2. In which text the word is plurall, [Deſolations:] to ſhew that the 70 years muſt include all the Calamities which fell upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> beginning even from the firſt of them, and were not ended untill the reign of the Kingdome of <hi>Perſia;</hi> namely, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> had conquered <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thereupon could ſay, All the Kingdomes of the Earth hath the Lord God of Heaven gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, and hath charged me to build him an houſe in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.20.23.</p>
                     <p>There is (ſaith <hi>Petavius</hi>) a double intervall of 70 yeares expreſſed in the Scriptures: the one by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> the other by the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> and is altogether ſtrange and differing from the former. The firſt intervall is from the firſt yeare of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to the two and twentieth year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> when he tooke <hi>Babylon:</hi> The ſecond is from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of the Temple and City, to the ſecond yeare of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hystaſpis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus he, in his twelfth booke and twenty fourth Chapter <hi>De Doctrina Temporum.</hi> And certainly he was not farre from truth in all this, as by that which I have already written may be ſeen. I account I confeſſe a little otherwiſe, but decline not his grounds: for in the firſt ſeventy I come two years lower then the two and twentieth of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and begin not the ſecond when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> deſtroyed the City and burnt the Temple, but when he laid his laſt ſiege againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4125. of which ſee more in the eighth Chapter and ſixth Section.</p>
                     <p>And now of all in this Chapter hitherto, this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> being ſent by his father upon an expedition into <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> came againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and beſieged it in the third year of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> &amp; by ſuch time at his third year was ended and his fourth a little entred, the Lord gave <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> into his hand, with part of the veſſels of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115738:85"/>houſe of God. This was in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4107. in the ninth Moneth: by reaſon whereof the Jews kept a Faſt in that Moneth; as is mentioned, <hi>Ier.</hi> 36.9. The Scripture accounteth this for the firſt yeare of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> reigne; as well it might: for not only now was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> taken in as a conſort with his father in the Empire, but alſo whilſt he was employed in this expedition his father died, even in the twentieth year of his reigne, as afterwards ſhall be proved. And note that <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> being now taken by this rod of Gods anger, to whom <hi>Judah</hi> and other Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations muſt be put in Subjection, was bound in fetters to be carried to <hi>Babylon</hi> among the other Captives [2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.6.] but went not: For afterwards in the way, by an agreement of ſervitude, he was releaſed and ſent home againe, and ſo became his ſervant, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 26.1. This was about the Spring time of the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4108. from whence the 70 years in <hi>Jeremy</hi> began, as without all further ſcruple may be freely granted: eſpecially conſidering that the firſt draught muſt be given to <hi>Judah,</hi> as may be ſeen in <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.18.29.</p>

                     <p>THat the Jews and other neighbouring Nations were delivered into the hands of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in the firſt yeare of his Kingdome, already hath been proved:
<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he tooke and deſtroyed in the nineteenth yeare of his reigne, at which time <hi>Tyrus</hi> thought her ſelfe ſafe and ſecure enough. She therefore rejoyced at the fall of that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115738:86"/>great City, and is thereupon threatned with deſtruction: for the power and might of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was to come againſt her. This was ſpoken in the eleventh year of <hi>Jechoniah's</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, which all men know was the nineteenth year of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar:</hi> and therefore till after this time there was no ſiege laid againſt <hi>Tyrus,</hi> witneſſed by the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.1.2. and at the ſeventh verſe moſt plainly. For thus ſaith the Lord God: Behold, I will bring upon <hi>Tyrus, Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Where note that he was not yet come, but was after this time to come againſt her. <hi>Scaliger</hi> therefore caſts his account amiſſe, when he reckoned that <hi>Tyrus</hi> was beſieged and taken before the time of this threatning.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Tyrus</hi> was beſieged thirteene years, we have it from <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his firſt book againſt <hi>Apion,</hi> who had it out of the Annals of the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi> Theſe eighteen yeares ſiege were in the reigne of <hi>Ithobalus,</hi> and began in the ſeventh yeare of his reigne, which was alſo the three and twentieth of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> as appeareth by accounting on to the 14 year of <hi>Irom;</hi> from the 14 year of <hi>Irom</hi> muſt (at leaſt in ſome part of it) fal into the firſt year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> here ſheweth: that is, into his firſt year over <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not into his firſt yeare over <hi>Perſia.</hi> And thus will this account agree wel with that already mentioned out of the 26. Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> although it differ much from that which <hi>Ioſeph Scaliger</hi> mainly ſtrives for. And note alſo that from the time at which <hi>Tyrus</hi> began to be beſieged to the death of <hi>Irom,</hi> are 54 yeares: which by this account is as right as can be.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore that <hi>Tyrus</hi> was taken in the end of the yeare of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4141. or in the beginning of the next year whilſt the ſeven and twentieth year of <hi>Iechoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's</hi> Captivity was ſtill running on: for then doth <hi>Ezekiel</hi> mention the taking of it: even after a long ſiege and ſervice againſt it; as may be ſeen, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.17.18. After which, <hi>Tyrus</hi> is to be forgotten till the end of thoſe ſeventy yeares which were the date of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Kingdome, began from the beginning of the Captivity: as the Peophet meaneth, in <hi>Eſa</hi> 23.15. A like Phraſe is in <hi>Gen</hi> 11.32. and in <hi>Exod</hi> 12.40. as

                     </p>
                     <p>This is the lift. By which it appeareth that <hi>Tyrus</hi> began to be beſieged in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4129. three years after the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and a little more then 13 yeares before the Conqueſt of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For this we are to note, that about the Summer time of the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4142. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> conquered <hi>Egypt,</hi> not many Moneths after <hi>Tyrus</hi> was taken, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.17, 18, 19, 20. This was the Six and thirtieth yeare of his reigne, or five and thirtieth yeare ending; being alſo the beginning of the firſt yeare of his abſolute Monarchie: before which time he had his dream of the foure Monarchies. For that dream could not be in the ſecond year of his abſolute MOnarchie after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Egypt;</hi> becauſe <hi>Tyrus</hi> (as we have ſeen) was firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115738:87"/>&amp; <hi>Egypt</hi> given him for his wages: but <hi>Daniel</hi> was famous before <hi>Tyrus</hi> was taken, and yet his wiſdome not knowne till the expounding of this dreame, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.3. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. In the ſecond year therefore of <hi>Daniels</hi> ſervice with the King he expounded this dream. For though it be ſaid, <hi>In the reigne of Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> yet are not thoſe words to be joyned with the former, <hi>in the ſecond yeare,</hi> as appeareth (ſaith one) by the Hebrew diſtinction, <hi>rebiah,</hi> ſet over the word <hi>ſhetaim, Second:</hi> but to ſhew that it was not in the Second yeare of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> For in the laſt words of <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt Chapter, it is ſaid, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> was to the firſt yeare of King <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Now therefore leaſt any ſhould thinke that this was done in the ſecond of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> direct mention is made of the reigne of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> This I thought good to touch at by the way, in regard of that miſtake which is among many who account the time of this dream to be in the ſecond year after the conqueſt of <hi>Egypt.</hi> More like it is that in theſe times <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſet up his golden Image, was famous for his ſtately buildings, had his dreame of the Tree, and twelve Moneths after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be madde: which I take to be about the end of the eight and thirtieth year of his reign. For in that year I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the firſt year of his madneſſe began, which laſted ſeven years: at the end wherof he was reſtored, and died ſoon after. For if his death had not been ſoon after the end of his madneſſe, it is thought he would have reſtored the Jews out of Captivity. But becauſe it was not he that muſt do this, it is like God took him away, and kept them ſtill in Captivity untill the firſt yeare of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus we have the right time alſo of the conqueſt of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King that reigned there then was <hi>Apries,</hi> or (as he is called by the Prophet) <hi>Hophra, Ier.</hi> 44.30. in whoſe two and twentieth yeare I thinke it probable that <hi>Amaſis</hi> rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, which thereupon perhaps was the cauſe why <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> ſaith he reigned but 22 years: whereas in <hi>Herodotus</hi> we finde that he reigned twenty five. And indeed it is not unlike but that <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſore ſhaken before <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:115738:87"/>came to conquer it, which therefore helped him to effect that he came for the ſooner &amp; with the greater eaſe. For what with the calamity of the <hi>Cyrenian</hi> warre, and what with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>Amaſis</hi> thereupon, the ſtrength and arme of <hi>Egypt</hi> was greatly broken, and ſo faire a way made for <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> to come and conquer it, as that he might quickly and with much eaſe performe the worke, the buſineſſe in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being done to his hand before he came: which agrees well to the ſpeech and phraſe of the Prophet, who ſaith that this Country was given to him as his wages for that great ſervice which he cauſed his Army to ſerve againſt <hi>Tyrus, Ezek.</hi> 29.18.19.</p>
                     <p>And note after all this, that <hi>Egypt</hi> was not reſtored untill the end of 40 yeares from hence. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 46.26. And if ſo, then ſhall <hi>Amaſis</hi> have but five yeares reigne after he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> by whom (as is very probable) he was intruſted with the Lieutenantſhip of the Country, as a reward for his rebellion againſt his naturall Prince, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that he thereby helped <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> there to fix his throne. For it is without queſtion, that <hi>Amaſis</hi> was neither 44 nor 55 yeares together King of <hi>Egypt</hi> after <hi>Apries,</hi> though <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodore</hi> tell us ſo. The truth is, the Prieſts of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> would not mention any thing of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, but did notably delude <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> with lyes, coyned upon a vaine-glorious purpoſe of hiding their owne diſgrace and bondage: and ſo theſe two being ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to that which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did there, becauſe they wanted the helpe of holy Scripture, reſted ſatisfied with any thing (though falſe) that the lying Prieſts would tell them. But as for us we know the contrary, and may not ſmother that which the word of God relateth: For thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts the God of <hi>Iſrael; Behold I will ſend and take</hi> Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar <hi>the King of</hi> Babylon <hi>my ſervant, and will ſet his throne upon theſe ſtones that I have hid, and he ſhall ſpread his royall Pavilion over them, Ier.</hi> 43.10.</p>
                     <p>But now ſee the liſt of them that reigned.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of the number of Kings that reigned in</hi> Babylon <hi>during the time of the Captivity.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe fragments of <hi>Beroſus</hi> and <hi>Megaſthenes,</hi> in accounting more Kings then three during the time of the Captivity, agree ſo ill with the Scripture as I know not how to build upon them. For they tell us of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Evilmerodach, Naragalraſar, Laboſardach,</hi> and <hi>Nabonidus:</hi> whereas in Scripture we find no more named then <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Evilmerodach,</hi> and <hi>Belſhazzar.</hi> And as no more named, ſo no more to be named nor reckoned for Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> during theſe times: For in Scripture this we find; This whole Land ſhall be a deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an aſtoniſhment; and theſe Nations ſhall ſerve the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> 70 years. And it ſhall come to paſſe when 70 years are accompliſhed, that I will puniſh the King of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and that Nation, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.11, 12. And againe, All Nations ſhall ſerve him, and his ſon, and his ſons ſon, untill the very time of his Land come: and then many Nations and great Kings ſhall ſerve themſelves of him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 27.7. And when 70 years are accompliſhed at <hi>Babylon,</hi> I will viſit you, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.10, For I will riſe up againſt them, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, and cut off from <hi>Babylon</hi> the name and rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, both ſon and nephew, ſaith the Lord. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 14.22. And againe, When there commeth a Nation out of the North, and layeth <hi>Babel</hi> waſt, then in thoſe dayes and at that time, ſaith the Lord, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall come weeping and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115738:88"/>enquiring the way to <hi>Sion, Ier.</hi> 50.4. Now that no part of this could goe beyound the death of <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> the third King, is apparant out of <hi>Daniels</hi> prophecy. For this (ſaith he) is the interpretation of the thing: MENE, God hath numbred thy Kingdome, and finiſhed it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.26. Where note, that if <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Kingdome were numbred and finiſhed at the death of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> then muſt no part either of his Kingdome, or of the 70 years be after that time: for not onely were the years of the Kingdome, but of the Captivity to end then, their dates by Scripture depending each upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is therefore ſaid in <hi>Eſay,</hi> that <hi>Tyrus</hi> (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we know was one of them that was to bear <hi>Babels</hi> yoake) ſhall be forgotten 70 years, <hi>according the dayes of one King, Eſa.</hi> 23.15. Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>[according to the dayes of one King]</hi> is certainly meant of one Kingdome, and is expounded ſo by a like phraſe in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.17, 23. Of one Kingdome I ſay; <hi>viz.</hi> The Kingdome of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Kingdome, continued onely to him, his ſon, and his ſons ſon: as was before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned out of <hi>Ier.</hi> 27.7. and <hi>Eſay</hi> 14.22.</p>
                     <p>Upon conſideration of which ſure it was,
<note place="margin">Hiſt. World. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4.</note> that Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the World could ſay; They who meerly follow the authority of the Scripture without bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing any helpe from others, name onely three Kings, <hi>viz. Nebuchadnezzar, Evilmerodach,</hi> and <hi>Belſhazzar.</hi> For which they have not onely the filence of <hi>Daniel</hi> for their warrant, who names none other; but even the promiſe of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> alſo, preciſely and in a manner purpoſely teaching the ſame, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.7. In which text be words expreſſing the continuance of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Empire, and number of the Kings, ſo as will hardly be qualified with any diſtinction. And indeed I finde no other neceſſity of qualification to be uſed herein, then ſuch as may grow out of mens deſire to reconcile the Scriptures unto prophane Authours: Which deſire were not unjuſt, if the conſent of all Hiſtories were on the one ſide, and the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the holy Text were ſingle on the other ſide. Thus he, very gravely and judiciouſly: and therefore, without ſome handſome way of reconcilement, I ſhall build no more upon
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115738:89"/>the Authority of this Fragment of <hi>Beroſus,</hi> then I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to done.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps a way may be found. Suppoſe we then this to be propable, That after <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> had reigned two years, that then he gave himſelfe to ſloth and luxury, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appointed <hi>Naragalrazar</hi> (his ſiſters husband) to be his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, which continued for the ſpace of four years: at the end whereof <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> either dyed or was ſlain by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buty, who thereupon ſtrove what he could to eſtabliſh the Kingdome to his owne ſon <hi>Laboſardach,</hi> albeit he were a child. But <hi>Nabonidus</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Balthaſar,</hi> or <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of ſuch an injury, prevailes againſt him: For though for nine moneths ſpace he was a little moleſted, yet at the end thereof he was quietly poſſeſſed of his Fathers throne, which he held for the ſpace of ſeventeen years; and was then ſlain at the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of his expedition took the City, and ſo ended the time of <hi>Babels</hi> Kingdome, in which the Nations were to ſerve <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> his ſon, and his ſons ſon.</p>
                     <p>This I confeſſe would ſeeme ſomething probable, were all things correſpondent: but here is ſo ſhort a time for the reign of theſe Kings, that they will be all dead and gone before the Captivity was ended: which can by no means be.</p>
                     <p>I remember therefore what is conjectured by the knight before mentioned, in his Hiſtory of the World, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 13. viz. That the ſeven years (or ſix years and nine moneths) given by <hi>Beroſus</hi> to <hi>Evilmerodach, Naragalrazar,</hi> and <hi>Laboſardach,</hi> are not to be reckoned after the death of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> but rather before; namely, in the time of his Madneſſe, and living Wilde: during which time, <hi>Evilmero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dach</hi> (having expected the recovery of his Father about ſome three moneths) reigned two years: then <hi>Naragalrazar</hi> having put him downe, rules four years: and laſt of all, <hi>Laboſardach</hi> nine moneths; in the end whereof <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is againe reſtored. Which opinion, though differing from that of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus</hi> and <hi>Pererius,</hi> who make <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> the ſole Regent in his Fathers abſence; and is alſo differing from that of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:115738:89"/>who (ſpeaking of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> madneſſe) ſaith, none durſt invade the Kingdome all thoſe ſeven years: yet for all that, I think no wiſe man will lightly eſteeme it; for it ſerves better to reconcile <hi>Beroſus</hi> to the Scriptures, then any other opinion that hitherto hath been extant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scaliger,</hi> in his Animadverſions upon <hi>Euſebius,</hi> expounds <hi>Beroſus</hi> otherwiſe, and ſaith <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> whom <hi>Naragalrazar</hi> ſlew, thereby to advance his own ſon, the nephew of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to the Septer, which himſelf ſwayed as Protectour in the minority of his ſon who was called <hi>Laboſardach:</hi> But <hi>Naragalrazar</hi> being dead, and his ſon more fit for a Chamber then a Throne, <hi>Nabonidus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt him &amp; ſlew him. This <hi>Nabonidus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Scaliger</hi>) is <hi>Darius Medus,</hi> and <hi>Laboſardach</hi> is that <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> mentioned by <hi>Daniel,</hi> according to his interpretation of the Prophet out of <hi>Beroſus</hi> and <hi>Megaſthenes:</hi> which indeed is but his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; who we know was in all thing ſingular, and in moſt things peremptory: and therefore though he ſcorneth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chronologers who ſubſcribe not to his magiſteriall Dictates, yet are his bare words no warrant, nor ſcornes good proofes to make us think his Tenets the onely true ones; no not here, in this now under queſtion: For the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Prophet points us out no other then <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, Evilmerodach,</hi> and <hi>Belſhazzar;</hi> as already hath been proved. Unto which let me add, that <hi>Herodotus</hi> calleth the laſt King of <hi>Babylon Labynitus:</hi> and who was this but <hi>Nabonidus</hi> in <hi>Bero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?</hi> and who was <hi>Nabonidus</hi> but <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> called by the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians Naboandel</hi> as ſaith <hi>Joſephus?</hi> &amp; who was <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> but he whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> conquered? as <hi>Xenophon</hi> plainly, with the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> beareth witneſſe. Note alſo further that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Medus</hi> was a <hi>Mede</hi> by birth, and not a <hi>Babylonian,</hi> being <hi>Darius</hi> of the ſeed of the <hi>Medes, Dan.</hi> 9.1. And if a <hi>Mede</hi> by birth, then how could <hi>Nabonidus</hi> be <hi>Darius Medus,</hi> who even in <hi>Beroſus</hi> himſelfe is ſaid to be a <hi>Babylonian?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as <hi>Daniel</hi> is againſt him, ſo alſo <hi>Eſay;</hi> ſhewing that he came not to his Kingdom by Election. For behold I will ſtur up the <hi>Medes</hi> againſt thee, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 13.17. The <hi>Medes</hi> therefore aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115738:90"/>
                        <hi>Babylon</hi> and took it, together with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> not by favour, but by violence, being aſſiſted by <hi>Cyrus</hi> kinſman to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> writeth. And good reaſon had <hi>Joſephus</hi> for it:
<note place="margin">Joſeph. antiq. <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>ca.</hi> 12.</note> For the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> was by the joynt forces of two, as in another Chapter of the ſame Prophecy may be ſeen. For thus hath the Lord ſaid unto me; Goe, ſet a whatchman; let him declare what he ſeeth: <hi>And behold he ſaw a Charet with a couple of horſes,</hi> Eſa. 21.7. and at the ninth verſe; <hi>And behold here commeth a Charet of men, and a couple of Horſemen:</hi> and he anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen.</hi> But by whom is it fallen? this the ſecond verſe ſheweth, in theſe words: <hi>Goe up, O Elam; beſiege, O Media.</hi> By which we ſee that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamites,</hi> and <hi>Medians</hi> (or the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes</hi>) united into one body, but under two Commanders, were the people foretold to come with joynt forces for the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon:</hi> theſe being that <hi>Ram</hi> with two hornes, in the eighth of <hi>Daniel. For the Ram which thou ſaweſt having two hornes, are the Kings of</hi> Media <hi>and</hi> Perſia, <hi>Dan</hi> 8.20. And hereupon it came to paſſe that at the taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> and death of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> the Kingdome was divided among the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Perſians, Dan</hi> 5.28. Howbeit the chiefe authority and power might be in the <hi>Medes:</hi> and therefore ſaith <hi>Jeremy, Make bright the arrows: gather the ſhields: the Lord hath raiſed up the Spirit of the Kings of the Medes: for his device is againſt</hi> Babylon <hi>to deſtroy it,</hi> Jer. 51.11. Which though it were, yet the dexterity in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediting this buſineſſe, and in uſing that Stratageme of
<note n="*" place="margin">See Xenoph. in his <hi>Cyrop. li.</hi> 7. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.36.</note> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the great river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> is aſcribed by <hi>Xenophon</hi> unto <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Nor doth <hi>Herodotus</hi> but name him the onely authour and beginner of this War: the reaſon whereof is, becauſe by his valour and skill the victory was gotten. Which being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, <hi>Cyrus</hi> forthwith intitles <hi>Darius</hi> to the Kingdome, both becauſe he was his Uncle and alſo his Elder, as Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> obſerveth; and as <hi>Xenophon</hi> likewiſe gives a touch at: telling us what <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt ſaid to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> after the taking of <hi>Babylon;</hi> namely that there was provided for him in <hi>Babylon,</hi> a choyce Palace with ſtately Edifices; that if he come thither he might keep his Court there as in his owne, <hi>Xenoph. lib.</hi> 8. Which is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115738:90"/>as if it ſhould be ſaid he had now conquered it for him, and he might if he pleaſed freely receive it: agreeing therein with the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> who ſaith that when <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was ſlain, <hi>Darius Medus</hi> received the Kingdome, being about threeſcore and two year old, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.30.31. But then again becauſe at this victory there were <hi>[Parſin]</hi> parters to ſhare the Empire, not of <hi>Madai</hi> onely, but alſo of <hi>Elam:</hi> we muſt know that <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Paras</hi> or <hi>Elam,</hi> excluded not himſelfe, but was fellow in Empire with <hi>Darius:</hi> and ſo the Kingdome was divided between the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Perſians,</hi> as in the hand-writing upon the wall was declared. And ſo likewiſe the Jews which were to ſerve the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> during the time of their Kingdome (which hath been already proved tobe 70 years) ſerved them till the reigne of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.20. Nor was this uniting but known to thoſe Greeks, in whom the <hi>Perſian</hi> Armies are called <hi>Medes,</hi> as I ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mention. To whom the ſeventy Tranſlaters applyed themſelves, when they put for the Hebrew text <hi>Paras,</hi> the terme <hi>Medes</hi> in this text of the <hi>Chronicles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further, as for <hi>Nabonidas</hi> formerly mentioned, queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe he was the ſame with <hi>Belſhazzar:</hi> for neither doth <hi>Joſephus,</hi> nor <hi>Beroſus,</hi> attribute to either of them more then 17 years. Nor doth <hi>Joſephus</hi> tell us any other thing then that <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was by the <hi>Babylonians</hi> called <hi>Naboandel,</hi> as before was noted: a name not far differing from <hi>Nabonidus</hi> in <hi>Bero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> but differing far enough from <hi>Darius Medus.</hi> To which <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth once again bear witneſſe, in ſaying, that <hi>Darius,</hi> together with <hi>Cyrus</hi> his allie, deſtroyed the ſtate of the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> as before was alſo noted: affirming moreover that he was the ſon of <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> and is otherwiſe called by the Greeks. And therefore in very truth, <hi>Darius Medus</hi> was not <hi>Nabonidus,</hi> but <hi>Cyaxares</hi> the ſecond; as <hi>Xenophon</hi> plainly and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly hath related.</p>
                     <p>Beſide all which, this alſo may be added, That the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> would not be ſo ſimple to deliver their Empire to a man who was a <hi>Mede,</hi> ſeeing they thought not ſo well of the <hi>Medes</hi> as of other Nations, becauſe the bounds of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115738:91"/>were enlarged far, and trenched much upon the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> greatneſſe, which made them therefore fearfull and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious over them. To which opinion (as ſaith <hi>Pererius</hi>) <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> addes no little force;
<note place="margin">Perer. on Da. Herodot. <hi>lib.</hi> 1</note> writing that <hi>Nitocris</hi> Queen of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and mother to <hi>Labynitus,</hi> did greatly fortifie the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> againſt the forces and invaſions of the <hi>Medes.</hi> Nay more, when the Lord rendred unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to all the Inhabitants of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> all their evill that they had done in <hi>Sion,</hi> he then ſtirred up the Nations with the Kings of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and the Captaines thereof, and all the Land of his Dominion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.24, 28. and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 13.17.</p>
                     <p>There is therefore more in it I ſee, then the bare delivering of the Kingdome to a man born in <hi>Media,</hi> and brought up in <hi>Babylon:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hiſt. World <hi>lib</hi> 3: <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.3.</note> for as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> truely gathered from hence, the <hi>Medes</hi> were cheife actors in the ſubverſion of the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Empire. And though the Greeks (ſaith he) aſcribe the conqueſt of <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Cyrus</hi> alone, yet the Scriptures teach uss that <hi>Darius</hi> was not onely King of <hi>Media,</hi> and had the <hi>Perſians</hi> to be his followers, but that the Army victorious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was his; being compounded of the ſtrength of both Nations, to wit, the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> with other the vaſſals of <hi>Darius,</hi> which were all led under the conduct of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who was cheife General of the Army, and had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the victory wholly given to him, who was the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preordained and forenamed by God himſelfe for this action, even for the ſake of his Church, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 45.1, 2, 3, 4. And againe, It is not (ſaith he) more certaine, that <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> Ioſt his life and Kingdome,

Neither was <hi>Joſephus</hi> to be the leſſe regarded, for affirming that <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was deſtroyed by <hi>Darius</hi> of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and his nephew <hi>Cyrus,</hi> though herein he varied from <hi>Beroſus,</hi> and others, whoſe authority elſewhere he gladly citeth. For <hi>Joſephus</hi> had no reaſon to beleeve any mans faith or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe times, halfe ſo well as <hi>Daniels,</hi> whom I beleeve that he underſtood, as was needfull in this caſe. Lawfull it was for him to alleage all Authours that had any mention, though unperfect, of the ſame things that were contained in the writings of the Jews, to whoſe hiſtories thereby he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured reputation in the Roman World, where they were ſtrangers, and might ſeeme fabulous. Even ſo <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and other writers, willingly embrace the teſtimonies of heathen bookes making for the truth in ſome particulars; yet will they not therefore be tryed in generall by the ſame, but leave them where they are againſt the truth; as <hi>Joſephus</hi> in this caſe hath left <hi>Beroſus.</hi> Thus that Knight.</p>

For firſt <hi>Daniel</hi> had viſions in the third year of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> and was then an officer in the Kings Court, as himſelfe declareth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8, 1.17. and therefore muſt needs be knowne to the King. Howbeit in that year which was the laſt of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> he was out of office and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; as may be ſeen at large in the fifth Chapter of the ſame Prophecy, where the Queen firſt tels the King of him, and the King alſo queſtioneth ſaying, Art thou <hi>Daniel?</hi>

For the King had offended them before, cauſing <hi>Gadata</hi> to be gelded, and the ſon of <hi>Gobryas</hi> to be ſlain in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> tell us.

Which even the Prophets words, in the place alleaged, well marked, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. For when the Poſts and Meſſengers went to and fro to inquire, it was to ſhew the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> that his City was taken at one end. And at the 39 verſe, the very drunken feaſt is foretold; at the which many were ſo overcome with wine that they ſlept: yea ſlept they did and waked not; for they were ſlain by the enemy before they awaked, and ſo they ſlept a perpetual ſleepe, as there the Prophet ſaith. Yea, and to ſhew that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had it in his minde to ſet the Jews free, if once the City was taken, he cauſed Proclamation to be made at his very entrance into it, that all who could ſpeak the Syriacke tongue (which the Jews could) ſhould keep within doores, and ſo be ſafe; as <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſheweth, <hi>lib.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>By all which I ſee, that they who reject <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> in theſe paſſages to embrace <hi>Beroſus</hi> and <hi>Megaſthenes,</hi> do runne upon the rocke of many a text in the aſſured word of

                     </p>
                     <p>There be indeed in <hi>Xenophon</hi> many things ſpoken high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in commendation of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and much <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> uſed to garniſh and ſet forth that Hiſtory, deſcribing in <hi>Cyrus</hi> the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of a moſt Heoricall Prince: yet nevertheleſſe the body and bulke thereof is founded upon meere Hiſtoricall truth. Putting therefore apart the Moral and Politique diſcourſ, and examining but the Hiſtory of things done, it will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that <hi>Xenophon</hi> hath handled his undertaken ſubject in ſuch ſort, that by beautyfying the face thereof, he hath not in any ſort corrupted the body: as is gallantly obſerved by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the world, lib. 3. c. 2. Section 3.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore that the laſt King of this Monarchy was <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> the firſt was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> &amp; the middlemoſt was <hi>Evilmerodach:</hi> and that the whole time among theſe three was 70 yeares, beginning from the time of <hi>Daniels</hi> Captivity, and agreement of ſervitude which <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> made with <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 26, 1. <hi>Ier.</hi> 25.2. The firſt of theſe had 44 yeares, as may be gathered out of Scripture; the ſecond 12, and the third 14, as <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> hath told us, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of his ſacred Hiſtory, affirming there, that ſo he found it an old <hi>Anonymus,</hi> wherein the times of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> were recorded. And why I ſay <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had 44 yeares as may be gathered out of Scripture, is, becauſe <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonia</hi> was carryed away Captive in the eighth year of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 24.12. and in the ſeven and thirtieth year after <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> began to reigne: which becauſe it was late in that yeare, might make <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> reigne to be ſome odd Moneths more then forty four years; as may be ſeen 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 25.27. <hi>Beroſus</hi> gives to <hi>Nabonidus</hi> 17 years, and him we have already proved to be <hi>Belſhazzar: Joſephus</hi> therefore ſaith that <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was ſlain in the ſeventeenth year of his reign: and if ſo, then muſt <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> have about 9 years; becauſe 44, 9 and 17 will make the full number of 70.</p>
                     <p>They that like this laſt account better then the former, may if they pleaſe embrace it. Or whether this or that, it is not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115738:93"/>much materiall: for the Scriptures have told us that God gave the empire of <hi>Babylon</hi> for 70 yeares, to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> his ſon and his ſons ſon: and therefore though there may be ſome ſmall difference in the particulars, yet doth that hinder nothing from being ſatisfied in the generall aſſured ſumme.</p>
                     <p>One thing more I would gladly touch at; and this it is: the death of <hi>Nabopollaſſar,</hi> who was alive when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> began his expedition againſt <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> but died ſoone after: probably about ſuch time as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> altered his purpoſe concerning <hi>Jehoiakim:</hi> For having bound him in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with an intent to carry him to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he agreed with him that he ſhould become his ſervant, and ſo ſent him home to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> which I take to be in regard of the newes of his Fathers death. And if ſo, then will the reigne of <hi>Nabopollaſſar</hi> be ſomething ſhort of 20 yeares. For whilſt ſome give him 29 yeares, ſome Copies of <hi>Ptolomey</hi> 25, other 21, I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke 19 to be the truer number, which in <hi>Beroſus</hi> his fragment is corruptly ſaid to be 29. or if 20, it muſt be but 20 running on: and ſo ſhall both the beginning of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and the beginning of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> after the death of his Father, be at one and the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4108. Howbeit the ordinary account of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buch adnezzars</hi> reigne is not to be taken from hence, but from the beginning of his expedition.</p>

                     <p>THe firſt year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> mentioned in Scripture, was not the firſt year of his reigne over <hi>Perſia,</hi> but the firſt year of his Monarchy which began at the conqueſt of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> and was a Date reckoned, not onely by the Jews as an <hi>Aera</hi> or <hi>Epocha</hi> firſt began in honour of their returne out of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115738:93"/>Captivity, but as the firſt year of a new Kingdome: in the beginning whereof the Jews indeed came out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> but the Record bearing date for this was found in a Coffer which was at <hi>Achmetha,</hi> a Provice of the <hi>Medes,</hi> in the Palace there, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6.2. We may not therefore with <hi>Joſeph Scaliger</hi> begin this Monarchy ſome certaine years after the taking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but at the very time thereof.

Or ſhall we ſay that when the one was extinguiſhed, the other was not as yet begun? Surely no. For <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, which repreſented the four Monarchies, was but one entire body, and withall an entire body: wherefore, as ſoon as the Head of Gold was cut off (which was at the

                     <p>IN this eighth Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Prophet relateth what he ſaw in a viſion concerning the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. The firſt whereof is deſcribed by a Ram verſe 4. The ſecond by a Goate, verſe 5.</p>

                     <p>This great horn then was <hi>Alexander ille magnus, Alexander</hi> the great, born 33 years before the beginning of the 114 <hi>Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad:</hi> at the day of whoſe birth the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was ſet on fire, which the Magicians interpreted to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that one then was borne who ſhould ſet fire on all <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At fifteen years of age he was committed by his Father to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> tuition, with whom (as <hi>Iuſtin</hi> reporteth) he ſpent five yeares in the learning of Arts and other knowledge meet for a King: and about the end of this time his Father died. Then began he to reigne; and having reigned 6 yeares he
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115738:94"/>prevailed over the <hi>Ramme:</hi> and by the end of ſix yeares more he is broken off. This was whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his fortunes were at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, as was ſignified, verſ. 8. for being returned from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and purpoſing to paſſe over into <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Weſterne parts, he died in the way at <hi>Babylon,</hi> where Embaſſadours from moſt parts in the world expected him. Some ſay he was poyſoned: but the moſt agree that he died of a ſurfeit which he gat at a Phyſitians houſe, where having firſt of all glutted himſelfe with eating, he drowned himſelfe in extreame quaffing and carouſing; through which diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he fell into a burning feaver and ſo died before he came againe into his owne Country.</p>
                     <p>His ſucceſſe in Battell was admirable: for he never encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred enemy but he overcame him, never beſieged City but he tooke it; and in three fights he overcame all the power of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> extending his Empire to ſuch a wonderfull largeneſſe, that he came not only to <hi>India</hi> and the river <hi>Ganges,</hi> and to thoſe places where <hi>Semiramis, Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> had ſet up Altars before him, but alſo conquered the more Noble parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Egypt:</hi> and theſe things done with ſuch cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that he might well appear to <hi>Daniel</hi> in one of his Viſions, with

                     <p>I May fitly make a difference between this little horn, and that mentioned in the ſeventh Chapter; becauſe this aroſe out of the third Monarchy; that out of the fourth: this out of a Beaſt which had but four hornes after the firſt was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; that out of a Beaſt which had ten hornes and trampled the other Beaſts under it's feet: this bore rule but 2300 natural dayes; that prevailed for a <hi>Time, Times, and halfe a Time.</hi> And albeit the third Monarchy be one while expreſſed by a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, another while by a Goate; yet muſt the Leopard mean the whole Kingdome of <hi>Alexander</hi> and his ſucceſſours, as well as the Goate: for the four heads on either of theſe Beaſts
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115738:96"/>proclame as much, as will be ſeene more plainly afterwards. But in the meane time this I ſet downe as certaine, That the little horne here mentioned, is no other then <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> who commited many and ſundry outrages both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other Nations, and alſo againſt the people of God, proceeding in prophaneſſe even againſt God himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>He is called a little horne, not becauſe his Kingdome was little or meane; but becauſe he was of a baſe flattring nature, having no true Princely quality or condition in him: and alſo becauſe he had no title to the Kingdom at the firſt, being the younger brother, <hi>Seleuchus</hi> the elder having an iſſue male alive at the ſame time when he began to take the Kingdome. This was his beginning: yet afterwards he came to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and was therefore called <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> which is <hi>famous or noble;</hi> or (as ſome ſay) <hi>Epimanes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jun. ex Polyb.</note> which is <hi>furious or mad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> was informed concerning the miſchiefe that he ſhould commit; and thereupon he telleth us what he heard one of the Saints ſay unto another certaine Saint, who was the numberer of <hi>Secrets</hi> or the wonderfull <hi>Numberer,</hi> namely, That the Sanctuary and the hoſt ſhould be troden under foot <hi>unto the evening and the morning two thouſand and three hundred,</hi> Dan. 8.13, 14. In which number we are not to underſtand ſo many years, but naturall dayes: for albeit a day is to be taken for a year in many reckonings and propheticall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in Scripture, yet never when the words Evening and Morning are annexed: for then they meane but ſuch dayes as are in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where it is ſaid that the <hi>Evening and the Morning were the firſt day. &amp;c.</hi> For that which is a Naturall day comprehendeth the day and night; or, as it is here, the <hi>Evening and the Morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Howbeit in 2300 dayes there will ariſe a number of certain years, which (by accounting 365 dayes to a year, and thirty dayes to a moneth) will amount to ſix years, three moneths, and twenty dayes. And albeit there be no preciſe point men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned from whence to account theſe ſix years, three months, and twenty dayes; yet this is certaine, that their end muſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115738:97"/>be fixed at the cleanſing of the Sanctuary: which, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> and the Authours of the firſt book of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
<note place="margin">Joſph. Antiq. <hi>lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. and Macc. 4.52.</note> was in the hundredth and forty eighth year of the Grecians. For whereas the <hi>Maccabees</hi> doe expreſly name the 148 year, <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith it was three years after the hundredth and five and fortieth, upon the 25 day of the ninth moneth which is called <hi>Caſleu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now then from this time ſubſtract ſix years, three months, and twenty dayes; and the head of your reckoning will fall into the hundreth &amp; two and fortieth year, the ſixth moneth, and fifth or ſixth day of the moneth: about which time <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> (
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Macc. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 13.16. and 20.</note> a little before he went into <hi>Egypt</hi>) gave leave to ſet up the faſhions of the Gentiles in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> returning againe (after he had ſmitten that Country) in the 143 year; at which time he came in his owne perſon againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> with a great multitude, and entring proudly into the Sanctuary, tooke from thence the Golden Altar, and Candleſtick of light, &amp;c. offring many ſundry outrages, as in the firſt book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> at the firſt Chapter doth well appeare.</p>
                     <p>And thus we have ſeen this little Horne, together with thoſe yeares wherein it prevailed after it was grown and waxen great. As for that other in the ſeventh Chapter, it cannot be the ſame with this, becauſe it aroſe in the dayes of the fourth Monarchy: of which ſee more in the following Chapter.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>I Was once almoſt drawne to think that this fourth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy ought to be taken for the divided Kingdome of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> or <hi>Seleucians:</hi> but now, upon a more diligent ſearch into the Prophecies concerning the four Monarchies, I have reaſon to conclude againſt it.</p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:115738:97"/>
                     <p>For firſt the third Monarchy (being the Kingdome of the Grecians) prevailed greatly over the face of the Earth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.39. Howbeitthe fourth Beaſt or Monarchy was ſtronger then the third, as appeareth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.40. where it is compared to <hi>Iron</hi> which ſubdueth all things: and in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7. <hi>It is ſaid to be exceeding terrible, ſtamping the reſidue under its feet:</hi> and verſe 23, <hi>It ſhall devour the whole Earth, and ſhall tread it downe and break it in peeces.</hi> Which if it be underſtood of the <hi>Seleucian</hi> or <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Kingdoms, is very improbable: for they (put caſe that we make them no part of the Grecian or third Monarchy) were nothing ſo ſtrong as it; neither did they trample the reſidue under their feet, ſeeing <hi>Alexander</hi> was not conquered by them; neither did they reigne ſo much over the whole Earth, as he had done before them, but were a great deale feebler then the Kingdome of <hi>Alexander.</hi> It is therefore ſaid after the breaking off the great Horne, that there were foure which ſtood up for it, being four Kingdomes of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not in his ſtrength; as it is, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.22.</p>
                     <p>To which ſome have anſwered,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                        </label> that this their ſtamping and treading under feet, is eſpecially meant of the people of God trodden down and perſecuted under <hi>Antiochus</hi> that great tyrant.
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> But I may well think this to be nothing elſe but a meere evaſion: for it is manifeſt that there was as much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to Religion before, as in the dayes of <hi>Antiochus;</hi> witneſſe that which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did when he ſet up his Golden Image, commanding that whoſoever would not fall downe and worſhip it, ſhould be caſt into the hot fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace: nay, that it muſt be made ſeven times hotter then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, for <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego, Dan.</hi> 3.6.19. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide, neither did <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſo prevaile againſt the Jews as if he had ſtamped them all in pieces: for in the end they reſiſted him, reſtored their Religion, and ſetled the ſtate of their Common-wealth: whereas this ſtrength and ſtamping is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meant of the Monarchies, one eating up and ſubduing another.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the <hi>Seleucians</hi> or <hi>Syrians</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo himſelfe, are ſaid to reigne as Grecians,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115738:98"/>and not as two Kingdomes divers from one Monarchy. Whereupon we read in the eighth Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the two horned Ram is expreſly meant of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> verſe 20, and that the Goate fignifieth the whole Kingdome of the Gecians,
<note place="margin">Dan. 8.20.21.22.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Alexonder</hi> and his ſucceſſours. For, at the one and twentieth verſe, <hi>The Goate is the King of Grecia, and the great horne which is betwixt his eyes, is the firſt King.</hi> Now that being broken, whereas four ſtood up for it, four King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes ſhall ſtand up of that Nation, but not in his ſtrength. If then there be a firſt King, there muſt be no more then one: and if more then one, the Monarchy could not end in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> and if the Monarchy did not end with <hi>Alexander,</hi> then the <hi>Seleucian</hi> or <hi>Syrian</hi> Kings muſt neceſſarily be part of the third Monarchy: and they being part of the third Monarchy, the fourth and laſt is the Monarchy of the Romans.</p>
                     <p>And now alſo, leſt it ſhould be thought that the third Beaſt of the ſeventh Chapter doth not likewiſe comprehend the whole Kingdome of <hi>Grecia,</hi> both of <hi>Alexander</hi> and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, the words of the ſixth verſe ſtand thus; <hi>After this I beheld, and loe there was another like a leopard which had upon his back four wings of a fowle; the beaſt had alſo four heads, and Dominion was given him.</hi> Theſe wings were Emblems of <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſpeedie conqueſts, together with that ſuddain diviſion of one body into four parts, ſoone after the great horne was broken off. The four heads are his four ſucceſſours; even as is ſeen in the eighth Chapter, and ſignified there by the four hornes of a Goate. By which it appeareth, that both <hi>Alexander</hi> and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, are comprehended under both Beaſts; for what the one expreſſeth by foure heads, is in the other alſo meant by four horns: then which there can be nothing plainer.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> is deſcribed by that little horn which came fourth of one of the foure hornes of the Goate, Chap. 8.9. Which beaſt is taken (as hath been already ſeen) for <hi>Alexander</hi> and his ſucceſſours, anſwering to the third beaſt of the ſeventh Chapter. But if <hi>Antiochus,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Seleucian</hi> Kingdome, be a part of the third Beaſt, he cannot alſo ſignifie the fourth or any part thereof: for then one
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115738:98"/>Beaſt ſhould be both the third and fourth Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Kingdome of this fourth Beaſt endeth with the deſtruction of that little horne which came up among the ten horns, Chap. 7.11. and then the everlaſting Kingdome of Chriſt ſucceedeth: but the Kingdome of the <hi>Seleucians</hi> ended not with <hi>Antiochus;</hi> many of that line ſucceeded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: and there was almoſt as many years from <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> death unto the comming of Chriſt, as there were from <hi>Alexanders</hi> death to <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, it is ſaid that the life of each Beaſt was prolonged for a certaine time and ſeaſon, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.12. But <hi>Alexanders</hi> reigne laſted no longer then ſix years and a few moneths, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deſtruction of the ſecond Beaſt, or <hi>Perſian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. And in ſo ſhort a ſeaſon, what Periods or converſions of times could be obſerved?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Beaſt in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is deſcribed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pattern of <hi>Daniels</hi> fourth Beaſt, having ten horns, and a mouth ſpeaking great things, and reigning alſo (under the regiment of that blaſphemous mouth) for the ſpace of 42 moneths, or for a Time, Times, and halfe a Time; as may be ſeen in the thirteenth and ſeventeenth Chapters of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing one and the ſame Beaſt is deſcribed in both Prophecies, neither in <hi>Daniel,</hi> nor in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> can be ſignified by either of them the Kingdomes of the <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Syrians.</hi> For look what things concerning this Beaſt are told to <hi>Daniel</hi> more ſuccinctly and abſtruſely, the ſame are revealed to Saint <hi>John</hi> more largely, and as it were with a kinde of explanation. And may not the ten toes in the feet of the Image, ſerve as certaine tokens to ſhew, that although the Beaſt had always ten horns in reſpect of the principal Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under it, yet the ten hornes called by the name of ten Kings are not to be looked for in the firſt dayes of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, but in the declining eſtate and weakned times of the Empire, as the toes ſignifie.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, it is ſaid <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.28. <hi>There is a God in heaven that revealeth ſecrets, and hath ſhewed to the King what ſhall be in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes.</hi> But the latter dayes are the dayes ſince the firſt
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115738:99"/>comming of Chriſt; this time being the laſt houre, and the laſt age,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2 18.</note> as Saint <hi>John</hi> hath told us: whereas the <hi>Syrians</hi> or <hi>Seleucians</hi> both began and ended long before Chriſt was born. The latter dayes therefore were not come till they were gone, and the prolonging of their kingdom come to an end: for (as I ſaid before) <hi>the life of each Beaſt was prolonged for a certaine time and ſeaſon,</hi> Dan. 7.12.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, in the dayes of theſe Kings or Kingdomes (<hi>viz.</hi> before they be all deſtroyed) the God of heaven ſhall raiſe up the eternall Kingdome of Chriſt, and of his Saints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. But if the fourth Kingdome be interpreted of the <hi>Seleucians,</hi> then theſe kingdomes were all extinguiſhed before Chriſts kingdome began, whether we reckon it from his firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming: whereas on the contrary, Chriſts birth fell into the reigne of the <hi>Romans;</hi> who are not utterly to be deſtroyed, in all and every relique, till his comming againe to judgement. Which is manifeſt by that of <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo in the ſeventh Chapter; namely, that there ſhall remaine ſome ſhew or relicts of the fourth Beaſt untill the thrones be ſet, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. and the Books be opened, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. and till the ſon of Man come in the cloudes of heaven, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. and till he get all dominion, and honour, and Kingdomes; and that all People, Nations, and tongues may ſerve him, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. and untill the Ancient of dayes cauſe judgement to be given, <hi>verſe</hi> 22. and till his everlaſting Kingdome come, which never ſhall have an end, <hi>verſe</hi> 27. All which doe properly belong unto the day of judgement, and ſecond comming of Chriſt: and therefore the fourth Monarchy muſt needs be meant of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and not of the <hi>Syrian</hi> or <hi>Seleucian</hi> Kingdome which was decayed and gone before Chriſt was born: for it fell firſt of all to <hi>Tigranes</hi> King of <hi>Armenia;</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> Yea, and at the death of <hi>Cleopatra Auguſtus</hi> was ſole Monarch, the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſurviver of the four heads and hornes, being then expired in the loſſe of <hi>Egypt:</hi> And ſo the fourth Beaſt trampled the reſt under his feet, as was foretold, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7.</p>
                     <p>And note that the <hi>Iews,</hi> in not expecting the comming of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115738:99"/>the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> untill the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy be deſtroyed, have put a falſe gloſſe upon <hi>Daniel.</hi> For it is (as <hi>Helvicus</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth) a vaine interpretation which they bring. For <hi>Daniel</hi> (in chap. 2. verſ. 44, 45.) doth not ſay that the Kingdome of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall come after the end of the fourth Monarchy,

                        <hi>Sed durante adhuc tempore ſeu periodo illorum regnorum;</hi> that is, in the dayes of thoſe Kingdomes, or before they be all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. <hi>Ergò falſò expectant id poſt finem Romani imperii. Nam durante ipſo quarto regno debebat regnum aliud (ſpirituale ſcilicet, &amp; aeternum) alterius conditionis ſuſcitari, quod eſt regnum Meſſiae.</hi> They doe therefore in vaine look for it after the end of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For even during the fourth Kingdome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Kingdome (<hi>to wit,</hi> a ſpirituall and an eternall one) of another condition was to be raiſed up, which is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> Nor doe ſome of their owne Writings but confirme this truth: For as the ſame Authour ſaith ſtill, in <hi>libr. Sanhedrim, cap. Chelek,</hi> it is expreſly written,
<note place="margin">Helvic. ibid.</note> That the ſon of <hi>David</hi> ſhall not come untill a wicked Kingdome beare rule; that is ſaith <hi>Rabbi Salomon,</hi> the Kingdome of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And in <hi>Midras Tillim</hi> upon the two and twentieth <hi>Pſalme; Surge in Edom, id eſt, Romanis, cum futurum eſt ut aſtare nobis facias regem Meſſiam,</hi> meaning, That God would cauſe to ſtand up for them in the dayes of the Romans, the King <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus I have delivered what I think to be true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fourth Kingdome in <hi>Daniel,</hi> firmely grounding upon ſuch proofes, as in my judgement cannot but carry the whole diſpute againſt <hi>Junius</hi> and all his followers: whom I honour both for their great learning and paines, although I cannot be their diſciple in this particular.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of the times and diſtances of the taking of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>by</hi> Pompie, Herod, <hi>and</hi> Titus.</head>
                     <p>THat which muſt be the chiefeſt Load ſtarre in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, muſt be the time of the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Herod;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Antiq. <hi>lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 28.</note> for which <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives us two plaine Characters: the one, that it was befieged and taken in a Sabbathical year; <hi>viz.</hi> after it began, and before it was ended: the other that it was taken in that yeare when M. <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Canidius Gallus</hi> were Conſuls. The time of their Conſulſhip was in the ninth <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4677, which was the fourth year of the 185 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and year of the building of <hi>Rome</hi> 716. And indeed in that year was a year of Reſt, which began from the Autumne before, and was not ended untill the Autumne thereof: how then could it be taken on the tenth day of the ſeventh moneth, as <hi>Langius</hi> ſaith it was? I am ſure it agreeth nothing at all to <hi>Joſephus</hi> to ſay that it was taken ſo late in the year: for, as he hath told us, not onely was it beſieged in a Sabbathical year, but even after it was taken, the year of Reſt was not ended, which makes him therefore ſay that the fields and grounds lay ſtill untilled, and were not ſowne becauſe of the year of Reſt. See this in his Antiquities, <hi>lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and compare it with what is in <hi>lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 28.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dion</hi> ſaith it was taken on the Sabbath day, <hi>lib.</hi> 49. and <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith it was in the third moneth at ſuch time as the <hi>Iews</hi> kept a ſolemne Faſt. The third moneth was <hi>Sivan,</hi> on whoſe three and twentieth day was a Faſt obſerved, by reaſon of the Idolatry of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin. Now in this year the firſt of <hi>Sivan</hi> was on the 31 day of <hi>May, feria ſexta:</hi> the three and twentieth of <hi>Sivan</hi> muſt therefore needes be on the two and twentieth day of <hi>June, feria ſeptima,</hi> or on the Sabbath day; For the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Sun was one, the Dominicall letters G. F. and the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Moon three.</p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:115738:100"/>
                     <p>Seven and twenty years before this,
<note place="margin">Dion. <hi>lib.</hi> 37.</note> 
                        <hi>Pompie</hi> alſo took <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> even on the ſame day of the Moneth; which according to <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Xiphilin</hi> was then alſo Sabbath day. And indeed ſo I finde it: for in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4650, the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Sun was two, the Dominicall letter E. and the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Moone 14. By which is gathered that the firſt of <hi>Sivan</hi> now was on the thirtieth day of <hi>May, feria ſexta:</hi> the three and twentieth therefore muſt be <hi>June</hi> the 21, <hi>feria ſepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> or Sabbath day, as the Dominicall letter ſheweth. And herein doe <hi>Joſephus, Dion,</hi> and <hi>Xiphilin</hi> well accord: all of them directing us to the foreſaid year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4650; to which if 27 be added, according to the direction of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> we have then the year of the Julian Period 4677, when <hi>Herod</hi> took it, as at the firſt was ſaid. And note moreover, that whereas <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith when <hi>Pompey</hi> tooke this City, C. <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and M. <hi>Tull. Cicero</hi> were Conſuls, that it is true of that year which I account: for though at that very time when the City was taken they were not in that office, yet in that year they began, even in the year of the Julian Period 4650, their office not expiring untill the ſame time of the next year: which I thought good to mention, becauſe the not obſerving it hath been an occaſion of ſeeking this time one year too late. The like may be alſo ſaid of the 179 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which began alſo in the ſame year, although a little after the City was taken: for the City was taken in <hi>June;</hi> the <hi>Olympiad</hi> began not untill the <hi>July</hi> next after. And as for the third moneth when it was taken, which learned <hi>Langius</hi> would not have to be the third moneth of the year, but of the ſiege; and thereupon directeth his Reader to <hi>Joſephus De bello Judaic. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. where the hiſtory of the taking <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> by <hi>Pompey</hi> is alſo related. To that I anſwer, that it hindreth not from accounting ſo as I have done; For the third moneth of the ſeige might be alſo the third moneth of the year, and is here proved to be ſo in regard of the day of the Faſt, and day of the week, when the City was taken, yea and of the year alſo, which muſt be (by <hi>Ioſephus</hi> his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) 27 years diſtant from the taking thereof by <hi>Herod.</hi> I
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115738:101"/>conclude therefore that <hi>Pompey</hi> going forth againſt <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in <hi>Niſan,</hi> and taking it in the third moneth after, muſt needes take it in <hi>Sivan;</hi> which becauſe it was on ſuch a day as the <hi>Iews</hi> kept a ſolemne Faſt, muſt be on the three and twentieth day of the ſame: which three and twentieth day of <hi>Sivan</hi> was this year on the one and twentieh day of <hi>June,</hi> and on the Sabbath day, as before was ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Indeed when <hi>Herod</hi> took it, the ſeige laſted longer by the ſpace of two moneths,
<note place="margin">De bell. Jud. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</note> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> plainly ſheweth. It began therefore ſooner: not in <hi>Niſan</hi> (which entred not till the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Aprill</hi>) but ſome moneths before,
<note place="margin">Ibid viz. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. Antiq. <hi>lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 27.</note> even when the worſt of Winter was paſt; which in one place of <hi>Joſephus</hi> is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>rigor hyemis:</hi> as thus, <hi>ubi autem rigor hyemis ceſſit, &amp;c.</hi> and in another place, <hi>ubi tempeſtas deſaeviit.</hi> Now we know that even in our Northerne Climate the worſt of Winter is paſt long before <hi>Aprill,</hi> which in hotter Countries, muſt be paſſed ſooner then with us by far. I reckon therfore that <hi>Herod</hi> came againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and laid ſeige againſt it, and that the <hi>Iews</hi> reſiſted him for five months ſpace before he took it: for he took not the City till the 22 of <hi>June</hi> next after, which was the three and twentieth of <hi>Sivan,</hi> and Sabbath day as well in this year as in that when <hi>Pompey</hi> took it; the authorities elſe of <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Xiphilin</hi> will be nothing worth; no nor the authority of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> for the Sabbathical year, which was running on whilſt the City was beſeiged, and withall was not ended when <hi>Herod</hi> had taken it: which well regarded will give no leave to that opinion maintaining that he took it not till the tenth day of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth moneth called <hi>Tiſri,</hi> as I have already ſhewed. Note alſo further,
<note place="margin">Antig. <hi>lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 28.</note> that on the fortieth day after <hi>Herod</hi> returned from the marriage of <hi>Mariamne,</hi> and that he and <hi>Soſius</hi> both of them bent their forces againſt the City, the firſt Wall was taken; fifteen dayes after that, the ſecond: for ſo I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in thoſe particulars. But that it were three moneths after this before the Temple and upper City was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I cannot think: for the Porches and outward Temple were taken and burnt even when the ſecond wall was taken;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115738:101"/>and then quickly after, the fury of the Souldiers ſet them on work to take the reſt, ſparing neither ſex nor age, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> alſo ſheweth. This was (ſaith he) in the hundreth and ſeven and twentieth year of the <hi>Aſſamonaean</hi> Family: but how we muſt account theſe years, I doe not well underſtand; unleſſe it be that we are to begin our account in the 150 year of the Greekes, which was in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4551. for then did <hi>Antiochus Eupator</hi> make a Covenant (though he quickly broke it) with <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that they ſhould enjoy their Laws and Liberties as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had done, 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 6.58. And indeed there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reckon from hence, ſeeing the end of theſe years is fixed in the death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> when <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Soſius</hi> took <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now alſo for the time when <hi>Titus</hi> took and deſtroyed this City, it muſt be one hundred and ſeven years after <hi>Herod</hi> had taken it; and theſe 107, not compleate but current. For <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed (as ſaith <hi>Ioſephus</hi>) by the <hi>Romans</hi> one hundred and ſeven years after <hi>Herod</hi> had taken it; yet ſo,
<note place="margin">Antiq. <hi>lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</note> as the deſtruction thereof by <hi>Titus</hi> muſt fall into the ſecond year of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> as he againe declareth.
<note place="margin">De bello Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daic. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. and <hi>cap.</hi> 18.</note> The time therefore when <hi>Titus</hi> deſtroyed it will fall into the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4783; which was in the hundreth and ſeventh year after it was taken by <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Soſius.</hi> For whereas <hi>Herod</hi> took it towards the latter end of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the year of the <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Period</hi> 4677; the Temple was burned by <hi>Titus</hi> his Soldiers in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the year of the ſame <hi>Period</hi> 4783, and the City in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> next after; the ſecond year of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> being begun on the <hi>Kalends</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> before. For there were (ſaith <hi>Xiphilin</hi>) from the death of <hi>Nero</hi> (who dyed on the ninth of <hi>Iune</hi>) to the beginning of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> one year and two and twentie dayes.</p>
                     <p>But of this deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by <hi>Titus,</hi> I ſhall ſpeake more afterwards in the laſt Chapter. I come therefore now to ſhew the true time of <hi>Herods</hi> reigne.</p>

                     <p>IT was near about ſuch time as the <hi>Romans</hi> were growing into a full Monarchy, that <hi>Herod</hi> the great, the ſon of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater,</hi> came to his Kingdome. He had a reigne of 37 years from that time wherein he was declared King by the Senate, and of 34 from the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by himſelf and <hi>Soſius,</hi> witneſſed by <hi>Ioſephus</hi>

                        </note> in ſundry places of his Writings. Then after him his ſon <hi>Archelaus</hi> reigned nine years compleat, and near the beginning of his tenth year was baniſhed by <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> And in the twentieth year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his other ſon <hi>Philip</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; having then had a reigne of 37 years after his Father, as

                        <hi>Ioſephus</hi> again declareth. <hi>Antipas</hi> alſo another of his ſons was <hi>Tetrarch</hi> of <hi>Galile,</hi> which he held from the time of his Fathers death untill the dayes of <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> who (by the meanes of <hi>Agrippa</hi>) baniſhed him into <hi>France.</hi> This <hi>Antipas</hi> was he by whom the Baptiſt was beheaded, and under whom out Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſuffered. <hi>Agrippa</hi> was the ſon of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> and Nephew to <hi>Antipas:</hi> for <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> was another of <hi>Herods</hi> ſons, who was put to death by his Father. And as for <hi>Agrippa,</hi> it was he who put <hi>Iames</hi> to death, and was himſelfe eaten up of Wormes. <hi>Herod</hi> King of <hi>Chalcis</hi> was this <hi>Agrippa's</hi> brother: he dyed in the eighth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and had his Kingdom gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Agrippa junior,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Agrippa ſenior,</hi> who reigned over it for the ſpace of four years: at the end whereof the Emperour takes it away from him alſo, and in the ſtead thereof gives to him the <hi>Tetrarchſhips</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Lyſanias, &amp;c.</hi> In them he reigned, and lived in friendſhip with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> untill the third year of <hi>Trajan;</hi> and was therefore alive thirty years after the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by <hi>Titus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is not that which I aime at: for that which I chiefly intend to prove, is, the true time of <hi>Herod</hi> the great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſe death our Saviour Chriſt was certainely borne.
<note place="margin">Math. 2.1.</note>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:115738:102"/>For (as the Scripture ſpeaketh) he was born in the dayes of <hi>Herod</hi> the King.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Herod</hi> (as I ſaid before) had a reigne of 37 years from that time wherein he was declared King by the <hi>Romans;</hi> and of 34 from the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by himſelfe and <hi>Soſius.</hi> The firſt of theſe reckonings began in the ſixth <hi>Iulian</hi> year, when Cn. <hi>Domitius Calvinus</hi> and C. <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls: the other, in the ninth <hi>Iulian</hi> year when M. <hi>Agrippa</hi> and L. <hi>Canidius Gallus</hi> were Conſuls. And if ſo, then the laſt of theſe years muſt certainly begin in the two and fortieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4710: <hi>Herod</hi> therefore dyed in the three and fortieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and year of the ſame Period 4711 before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> when from his firſt beginning he had reigned 37 years compleat; and from his ſecond, 34 years current. <hi>Petavius</hi> ſtrives for the year before this, and that chiefly in regard of an Eclipſe of the Moon which was then on the thirteenth day of <hi>March:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Kepl.</hi> in his <hi>Silva Chro.</hi> annexed to his book <hi>De novis ſtellis,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tav.</hi> in his <hi>Doctr. Temper.</hi> lib. 11. cap. 1.</note> for in the 42 <hi>Iulian</hi> year was an Eclipſe of the Moon on the thirteenth day of <hi>March,</hi> about three houres before Sun-riſing, continuing two hours &amp; 47 minutes; the digits eclipſed being ſix, as <hi>Kepler</hi> &amp; <hi>Petavius</hi> have obſerved. Now this they think to be that Eclips which <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſpeakes of in his <hi>Antiquities, lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. But in caſe <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſhould there meane a naturall Eclipſe of the Moon, yet could not this be it; for there was too ſmall a ſpace between the thirteenth day of <hi>March,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſter</hi> of this year (which was on the eleventh of <hi>Aprill</hi>) to have all thoſe things done which <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentions to be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that time of the Moones darkneſſe and the death of <hi>Herod.

Of which, <hi>Calviſius</hi> alſo ſpeaketh, ſaying; <hi>Nullibi hoc anno hiſce diebus, quando Octavius urbem ingreſſus eſt, Eclipſis Solis inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur, quam anxiè inquirit Harwartus ab Hohnburg. Concludendum igitur fuiſſe aliquod Phaenomenon in Sole, &amp;c.</hi> So alſo when <hi>Xerxes</hi> moved from <hi>Sardes,</hi> there was (as ſaith <hi>Herodotus</hi>) a great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Sun in a cleare aire; which almoſt all Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers taking to be meant of an Eclipſe at that time, have grievouſly tormented and vexed themſelves to finde it out: but fayling to finde any at the right time, they have moved this march of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> ſome to one year, and ſome to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that thereby they might fit it to an Eclipſe, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there was no Eclipſe meant, but onely ſome <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> ſtrange ſight, or miraculous diſappearing of the Sunne for a ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>Beſide, if that Eclipſe of the Moon in the two and fortieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year muſt ſerve as a true Character to ſhew the time of <hi>Herods</hi> death, then how ſhall the years of his reigne be made good? for in the beginning of that year <hi>Herod</hi> had reigned but 36 years from his firſt beginning, and not 33 from his ſecond beginning. The two and fortieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year could not therefore be the yeare of <hi>Herods</hi> death; no evaſion can ſerve to bring it up ſo high, but upon neceſſity it muſt be in the year next after, and that was the three and fortieth year.</p>
                     <p>As much alſo doe they erre who bring his death downe to the 44 <hi>Iulian</hi> year: for it is directly againſt the teſtimony of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> to ſay that <hi>Herod</hi> was not made King by the <hi>Romans</hi> till a little before the end of the ſixth <hi>Iulian</hi> year.
<note place="margin">Antiq. <hi>lib</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.26.</note> It was Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time indeede when he hazarded himſelfe upon the Seas to come to <hi>Rome</hi> where the Senate made him King; but it was not the Winter that entred near the end of the ſixth <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> year: for then the <hi>Olympiad</hi> was not 184, but 185. Now we know it from <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> that <hi>Herod</hi> was made King by the <hi>Romans</hi> in the 184 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as well as when <hi>Domitius Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> were Conſuls; for if we take onely this
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115738:103"/>and not likewiſe that, we lay hold but upon halfe our teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: And if in the 184 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> then before the Winter which entred near the going out of their Conſulſhips. The <hi>ſeries</hi> therefore of the paſſages in <hi>Ioſephus</hi> which concern this,
<note place="margin">Antiq. <hi>lib</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 24 25. 26.</note> ſtandeth thus; namely, that at the Pentecoſt of the fifth <hi>Iulian</hi> year <hi>Herod</hi> was in <hi>Iudea:</hi> at Autumne he purpoſed to goe from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> but was hindred by a great tempeſt, and came not to <hi>Rome</hi> till a good part of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was entred, and that the new Conſuls were in their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; who, entring on the firſt day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> tell us plainely that it was in the beginning of the ſixth <hi>Iulian</hi> year when the Senate made him King. I commend <hi>Calviſius</hi> therefore in this particular, for he hath here faithfully delivered the minde of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> though he afterward wrong him as much in ſetting the death of <hi>Herod</hi> in the 45 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, which is two years after the end of thoſe 37 years that <hi>Ioſephus</hi> giveth him. But there was an Eclipſe of the Moon in the 45 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, on the ninth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> at the thirteenth houre, which laſted for the ſpace of foure houres, and that's the reaſon why <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Calviſius</hi> kept <hi>Herod</hi> alive till then. Howbeit it is not that will ſerve their turne, for <hi>Herods</hi> longeſt time of reigne being but 37 years from his firſt beginning, will have him dead two years before the time that they mention, doe what they can.</p>
                     <p>And as <hi>Herods</hi> owne yeares be againſt them, ſo are the yeares alſo of his ſonnes, <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Philip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For firſt, <hi>Archelaus</hi> had but nine yeares compleat after his Father, and was baniſhed in the tenth; and that's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>Joſephus</hi> in one place gives him nine years, and in another place ten; telling us moreover that he was baniſhed in the ſeven and thirtieth yeare of the <hi>Actium</hi> fight.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ant. l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> The ſeven and thirtieth yeare of which fight began in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one <hi>Iulian</hi> yeare, on the ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> and ended at the ſame time in the next year: in the beginning therefore of the 52 <hi>Iulian</hi> year was the baniſhment of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after he had begun the tenth yeare of his reigne; which ſtill ſheweth the death of <hi>Herod</hi> to be at the time aforeſaid.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115738:104"/>This is alſo further confirmed by <hi>Dion</hi> [<hi>lib.</hi> 55.] writing that <hi>Herod</hi> of <hi>Palestine</hi> being accuſed of his brethren, was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> when <hi>Emilius Lepidus,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Arruntius</hi> were Conſuls, which was in the 51 <hi>Iulian</hi> year. By which difference between him &amp; <hi>Joſephus</hi> I take to be meant, that the accuſation againſt <hi>Archelaus</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> neare the end of the 51 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and that then the Emperour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed his baniſhment; but before it could be effected, and he take notice of it by being actually put out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the Preſident ſent to confiſcate his Goods, both the two and fiftieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year and tenth year alſo of his reign was begun. And note alſo further, that by this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Dion</hi> it well appeareth, that <hi>Archelaus</hi> was ſometimes called <hi>Herod</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> or <hi>Herod Archelaus;</hi> which is nothing ſtrange, becauſe others of the ſame ſtocke had the like <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomen,</hi> or forename. As for Example, his name who was the Tetrarch of <hi>Galilee</hi> when the Baptiſt was beheaded, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom our Saviour ſuffered, was <hi>Antipas;</hi> howbeit he was alſo called <hi>Herod, Luke</hi> 23.8. Alſo <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſonne of <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi> had not only the name of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> but of <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12.19. and ſo I do not doubt but that <hi>Archelaus</hi> was alſo ſometimes called by the name of <hi>Herod.</hi>

                        <hi>Philip</hi> dyed in the twentieth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and in the ſeven &amp; thirtieth year after his Father. The twentieth of <hi>Tyberius</hi> began in the 78 <hi>Iulian</hi> year on the nineteenth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ended not until the ſame time in the next year: the death of <hi>Philip</hi> therefore was in the 79 <hi>Iulian</hi> yeare before the nineteenth of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and conſequently the death of <hi>Herod</hi> in the three and fortieth yeare, as at the firſt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Scaliger</hi> did ſomewhat ſticke at theſe things; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his conjecture was that there might be ſome fault in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> and that for the 20 yeare of <hi>Tyberius</hi> we ought to read the 22; which he found warranted by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> an ancient inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of <hi>Joſephus.</hi>

                        </note> But <hi>Kepler</hi> anſwereth, that the Greeke Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> are of better credit; and that the fault there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is in the Latine, which we may not preferre above the Greeke, becauſe the one is the Tranſlation, the other the Originall.</p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:115738:104"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, after <hi>Philip</hi> had gotten the Tetrachſhip of <hi>Galile, Ioſephus</hi> telleth us that he built a Towne, and in the honour of <hi>Iulia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> called it <hi>Iuliada;</hi> which certainely he did whilſt <hi>Iulia</hi> was in favour, otherwiſe he had tranſgreſſed againſt the Emperour: but <hi>Iulia</hi> was out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and baniſhed for her foule adultery, in the foure and fortieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year; And therefore <hi>Herod</hi> could not be alive in the beginning of the next year (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> would have him) becauſe this Towne was not built by <hi>Philip</hi> till after his Fathers death.</p>
                     <p>And as for the baniſhment of <hi>Iulia,</hi>

                           <hi>Dion lib.</hi> 48.</note> that it was in the yeare aforeſaid, is thus proved. She was born (ſaith <hi>Dion</hi>) when <hi>Marcus Cenſorinus</hi> and <hi>Calviſius Sabinus</hi> were Conſuls; and from thenceforth flouriſhed and lived in her Fathers favour, and in the favour of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi>

                           <hi>Macrob. Sat. lib.</hi> 2. cap. 5.</note> untill (as ſaith <hi>Macrobius</hi>) the eighth and thirtieth yeare of her age.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men were Conſuls in the ſeventh <hi>Iulian</hi> year; the eight and thirtieth from whence, was (ſure enough) the foure and fortieth: in which year <hi>Ceſar</hi> himſelfe was the thirteenth time Conſul.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ioſephus</hi> alſo teſtifieth, that after <hi>Herod</hi> was dead, the ſonnes of <hi>Herod</hi> contended before <hi>Auguſtus</hi> concerning their Fathers Heritage; and then <hi>Cajus</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſat in judgement: but <hi>Cajus</hi> was abſent and gone into <hi>Syria</hi> in the ſame year that <hi>Iulia</hi> was baniſhed; And therefore <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> muſt needes be dead before that time.</p>
                     <p>And that <hi>Cajus</hi> went ſo ſoone into <hi>Syria</hi> may thus be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. He was borne (as <hi>Dion</hi> ſheweth) in that year when <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius</hi> and <hi>Nerva</hi> were Conſuls, which was in the ſix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year: in the nineteenth year after he went into <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and afterwards into <hi>Armenia,</hi> returning no more; for he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 49 <hi>Iulian</hi> year when <hi>Sex Aelius</hi> and <hi>Sentius</hi> were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls as is teſtified by <hi>Paterculus. Tacitus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quirinus</hi> was made an Overſeer to <hi>Cajus Ceſar,</hi> not being twenty yeares old when he went to Warres in <hi>Armenia.

                     <p>But what need I urge theſe two laſt proofes thus far, ſeeing thoſe before them are ſufficient? I conclude therefore that <hi>Herod</hi> dyed in the forty three <hi>Iulian</hi> yeare, about the ſix and twentieth day of <hi>February,</hi> which was three and thirty dayes before Eaſter: for that he dyed ſo long before Eaſter appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the great Pompe and State at his Funerall, together with ſome other circumſtances mentioned by <hi>Ioſephus.</hi> Three and thirty dayes before; that's the leaſt, it might perhaps be forty, which will therefore make his death to be on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of <hi>February, feria tertia;</hi> that being the fift day of the twelfth Moneth <hi>Adar,</hi> thirty ſeven yeares compleat from his firſt beginning to reigne, and thirty four current from the death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> when he and <hi>Socius</hi> tooke <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no objection of moment that can be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: howbeit becauſe ſomething is objected, I ſhall not be wanting to give an anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Our Country-man <hi>Lydiat</hi> hath greatly taxed <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> as if herein he had reckoned amiſſe, but it was an unjuſt cenſure. For queſtionleſſe thoſe things wherein he blameth him, and would make the world thinke him to be faulty, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been forgotten by his adverſarie <hi>Apion,</hi> if in them he had been worthy of blame.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Cavill which I ſuppoſe can be urged, is out of the fourteenth booke of his <hi>Antiquities,</hi> at the beginning of the ſeventeenth Chapter, where <hi>Herod</hi> is ſaid to be of the age of fifteene yeares in the time of the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> battell, which was in the year of the City 705, and yeare of the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Period,</hi> 4666. from whence he lived untill he was about ſeventy yeares old: teſtified alſo by the ſame Author in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Booke of his <hi>Antiquities</hi> at the eight Chapter, and in his firſt Booke <hi>De bello Iudaico</hi> at the laſt Chapter. From whence it followeth, that <hi>Herod</hi> dyed not till the year of the <hi>Iulian Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod</hi>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:115738:105"/>4720. which was the 52 <hi>Iulian</hi> year when <hi>A. Licinius</hi> and <hi>Q. Caeeilius</hi> were Conſuls. Which if it be true, then muſt not the beginning of his reigne be untill the firſt year of the <hi>Actium</hi> fight, where <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſetteth the ſeventh yeare of his reigne and not the firſt, even the ſeventh of his 34 yeares accounted from the taking of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by him and <hi>Socius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some indeed (and among them Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> and our Country-man <hi>Lydiat</hi>) begin the thirty ſeven years of his reigne but then; grounding chiefly upon this, That that fight being ended, and the Victory falling on the ſide of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, Herod</hi> (who had taken part with <hi>Antonius</hi> againſt him) came as a ſuppliant, laid downe his Crowne, and had never more taken it up if <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Conqueror had not been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable and given him leave againe to weare it: ſo that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his Crowne at that time from the hands of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> he at that time began the 37 years of his reign. A weake argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I dare boldly ſay; for this, at the moſt, was but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of his offence, and thereupon the confirming of him in his former Royalty and reigne begun ten yeares before this time of the <hi>Actium</hi> victory. For ſhould he reigne thirty ſeven yeares from hence, and after him <hi>Archelaus</hi> nine, then where ſhall we finde roome for them that governed in <hi>Iudea</hi> after <hi>Archelaus</hi> was removed from his Kingdome.

Tirinius</hi> alſo, in his Comment upon the holy Bible, is of the ſame opinion; and therefore he placeth the birth of <hi>Herod</hi> in the fourth yeare of the 176. <hi>Olympiad;</hi> from whence to the three and fortieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year we have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty yeares; about which age <hi>Herod</hi> was when he dyed: For the fourth year of the 176 <hi>Olympiad</hi> was in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4641. and the three and fortieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year in the year of the ſame <hi>Period</hi> 4711. which was 70 yeares after. So alſo it will be if you account forty five from the yeare of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4666. when the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> battell was: for in that battell <hi>Herod</hi> was twenty five, to which adde forty five, and ſo ſhall his age be ſeventy in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4711, as hitherto hath been proved.</p>
                     <p>But doe I not heare it yet objected, that the death of <hi>Herod</hi> will be far later then I have hitherto mentioned, and that becauſe the time of <hi>Archelaus</hi> his baniſhment was not till the reigne of <hi>Tiberius? Ioſephus</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> are compared to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this objection. For firſt, <hi>Ioſephus</hi> is witneſſe that <hi>Archelaus</hi>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:115738:106"/>was married to <hi>Glaphyra</hi> the daughter of <hi>Archelaus</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> whoſe laſt husband before him had been <hi>Iuba</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> Now <hi>Iuba,</hi> as is in the ſecond place alleaged out of <hi>Strabo,</hi> was alive till towards the middle of the ſecond year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and therefore <hi>Archelaus</hi> marrying his Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, could not be baniſhed till the end of the ſaid year, or beginning of the next.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, firſt that
<note n="*" place="margin">Maſter <hi>Tho. Lydyat.</hi>
                        </note> he who makes this objection is not conſtant to himſelfe: for in his Book <hi>De emendat. Temp.</hi> page 162. he placeth the the baniſhment of <hi>Archelaus</hi> in the laſt year of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſaying that he was not baniſhed in the 37 year of the fight at <hi>Actium,</hi> but in the 37 year after <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had received that power and dignity which was called <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunitia poteſtas;</hi> and thereupon he diſſenteth every way from <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> and gives him but eight years after his father. Then, in another book, written on purpoſe to confirme the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of his firſt, he would not have <hi>Archelaus</hi> baniſhed till the dayes of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in regard of <hi>Iuba</hi> who was alive till then, and whoſe Widdow he married, as formerly hath been ſaid. But to this I have a ſecond anſwer, to wit, that in <hi>Strabo</hi> we finde more <hi>Iuba's</hi> then one who were Kings of <hi>Mauritania</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch time as the <hi>Romans</hi> were the greateſt Monarchs in the World: and therefore it were little leſſe then great folly to diſtrub the times by pitching upon none but the laſt to be him whoſe Widdow <hi>Archelaus</hi> ſhould marry. We may as well ſay that among the Popes <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt and <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond were both one: Or that among the Kings of <hi>England, Richard</hi> the firſt and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond were the ſame. See therefore what <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, in the end of his ſeventeenth and laſt book, in the Deſcription of <hi>Mouritania:</hi> After <hi>Syphaces</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Maſiniſſa</hi> obtained the Kingdome, and then <hi>Micipſa</hi> and his ſucceſſours; and in our times <hi>Iuba,</hi> who was father to that <hi>Iuba</hi> who dyed lately.</p>
                     <p>And thus much concerning the times of <hi>Herod</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. The next thing to be ſpoken of, is the birth of Chriſt: of which in the following Chapter.</p>

                     <p>For firſt, the Ancients: they are divided and tell us thus. When <hi>Calviſius Sabinus</hi> and <hi>Lucius Rufinus</hi> were Conſuls, then was Chriſt borne, according to <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> in the ſecond book of his ſacred Hiſtory: this was in the 42 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4710. But when <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Meſſalinus</hi> were Conſuls, then was Chriſt borne, according to <hi>Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, Caſſiodorus, Maximus Monachus,</hi> and <hi>Cedrenus:</hi> this was in the 43 <hi>Julian</hi> year. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> are for the next year, when <hi>Ceſar</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> time and <hi>Sillanus</hi> were Conſuls: this was in the 44 <hi>Julian</hi> year. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius Exiguus</hi> pitcheth upon the next year after, when <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Piſo</hi> were Conſuls.</p>
                     <p>By which teſtimonies we finde how the Ancients were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and that from them may be gathered four ſeverall years for the birth of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Modernes; <hi>Dekerius</hi> and <hi>Petavius</hi> are for the one and fortieth <hi>Julian</hi> year: <hi>Kepler</hi> for the fortieth; and M. <hi>Antonius Capellus Franciſcanus</hi> for the nine and thirtieth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scaliger</hi> goeth along with them who pitch upon that year when <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Meſſalinus</hi> were Conſuls; <hi>Bucholcerus</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and ſo doe many others. But that which is the lateſt taken up, is the 48 <hi>Julian</hi> year, three yeares latter then the common account; and is mainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

                     <p>Thus they. But I for my part ſhall abſolutely rely upon none of them: for no authority without good ground can be ſufficient. And therefore my courſe herein ſhall be this; that having already (out of

                        <hi>Joſephus</hi>) found the true time of <hi>Herods</hi> death, I ſhall next ſeek for the birth of Chriſt in ſome year before it, as by Scripture I am directed: And if in that I can have any of the Ancients to guide me, I ſhall gladly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, otherwiſe not.</p>
                     <p>Or to make my way the more plaine, I ſhall firſt note the year of <hi>Herod,</hi> in which the Ancients ſay Chriſt was borne. Secondly the year of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> and Thirdly, the time of the generall taxing, when all the world under the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire went to be taxed. For as in Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> we read, that he was borne in the dayes of <hi>Herod</hi> the King, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.1. So in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> we reade, that it was in the dayes of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> when the Decree was gone forth that all the World ſhould be taxed, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.1.</p>
                     <p>And for the firſt, we have the teſtimony of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Severus Sulpitius,</hi> expreſly noting that the three and thirtieth year of <hi>Herod</hi> to be the time of our Saviours birth: Which will be proved true, if it be rightly taken: For it might very well be his three and thirtieth year, not from his firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to reigne, but from the time that he &amp; <hi>Soſius</hi> took <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> elſe ſhould Chriſt be 36 years old when he was baptized, which is certainely falſe. <hi>Herod</hi> therefore could not be alive four years after the birth of Chriſt, although <hi>Epiphanius</hi> as well as <hi>Sulpitius</hi> hath written ſo; for they having an eye only to his 37 years, miſtook themſelves in this particular, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon have caſt the years of Chriſt afterwards into wrong years of <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Antipas,</hi> as is plainly manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond, <hi>Tertullian</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> point us to the 41 year of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> But from whence muſt this 41 year be accounted? Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> joynes it with the 28 year of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> and yet ſeemes to compute both that 28 year, and the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115738:108"/>41 year, from one time; which is very abſurd. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it from the death of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> not onely againſt the truth of the thing it ſelfe, but alſo againſt his owne reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; who writeth that after this, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> lived fifteen years, and yet reigned but 43 after <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> From which confuſed &amp; contradictory accounts of theirs it well appeareth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they found in ſome ancient Rolls &amp; publick Records of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that there was a general taxing of the World by <hi>Augustus</hi> about ſuch a year as bore the date of an one and 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year, yet from whence to derive the right head of their reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning they were either careleſſe or altogether ignorant. I ſhould therefore think, that by this 41 year was meant the 41 <hi>Iulian</hi> year: for with that, the three and thirtieth year of <hi>Herod</hi> (before mentioned) doth exactly accord. <hi>Jrenaeus,</hi> more ancient then either of theſe, affirmes it to be about the 41 year of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> For <hi>Natus eſt Dominus noſter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>circa primum &amp; quadrageſimum annum Auguſti imperii,</hi> lib. 3. <hi>contra. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ.</hi> cap. 25. And in this, he is none of the worſt Authours: for Chriſt being born on the 25 day of <hi>December,</hi> and in the 33 year of <hi>Herod,</hi> was born in the latter end of the 41 <hi>Julian</hi> year, and ſo near the beginning of the 41 year of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> from the death of <hi>Julius Ceſar,</hi> that there were but ſeven dayes wanting to make his birth fall fully into it. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from hence, that the firſt year of Chriſt was (for the moſt part of it) in the 41 year of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and that Chriſt was born but ſeven dayes before that year took beginning. For he was born in the 41 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, on the 25 day of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember:</hi> that day being accknowledged and kept for the day of his Nativity throughout many ages long before our times, as in the Chapter next following ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>Come we then now to the third and laſt thing that I noted to be a directour to us in this particular: I meane the time of the generall taxing, when all the World under the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire went to be taxed. In the ſearching after which, this I finde; <hi>viz.</hi> that in all the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> there were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three generall taxings: and in one of thoſe three it muſt neede be that Chriſt was born; witneſſe the words of Saint
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115738:108"/>
                        <hi>Luke,</hi> ſaying, <hi>There went out a Decree from</hi> Auguſtus <hi>that all the World ſhould be taxed,</hi> Luke 2.1. By which words it appeareth that we muſt not ſeek for Chriſts birth at the time of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular taxing, but at a ſuch time as there was a generall tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And that there were three ſuch taxings in the dayes of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> is teſtified by <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the life of the ſaid Emperour, about the end of the ſeven and twentieth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; where he telleth us that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made three general tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>Cenſum populi ter egit; primum ac tertium cum Collega; medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſolus.</hi> The firſt of theſe was too ſoone for the birth of Chriſt: for it was (as <hi>Dion</hi> ſheweth, <hi>lib.</hi> 52. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 53.) when <hi>Ceſar Auguſtus</hi> the fifth time, and <hi>Sextus Apuleius</hi> were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls; <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſeventeenth <hi>Julian</hi> year, and year of the City 724, which was but the twelfth year of <hi>Herods</hi> reigne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his firſt beginning, and 56 years before the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And as for the laſt, it was too late: for when that began, <hi>Herod</hi> had been ſixteen years dead well nigh. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth therefore that Chriſt muſt needs be born in the time of the middle taxing: for if the firſt were too ſoon, and the laſt too late, then muſt the birth of our Saviour be for certaine in that which was between both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Kepler</hi> referreth the beginning of it to the 36 <hi>Julian</hi> year, when thoſe incredible Conqueſts of <hi>Druſus, Tiberius,</hi> and L. <hi>Piſo</hi> had purchaſed a peace to the Empire: But he was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his reckoning without all queſtion. For firſt, when this taxing began, <hi>Cyrenius</hi> (or as he is otherwiſe called, <hi>Quirinius</hi>) was Preſident of <hi>Syria,</hi> which could not be untill the fifth year after his Conſulſhip; for untill ſuch a time not any who had been Conſul, could be ſent as an Officer into the Provinces, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Dion</hi> tell us: and therefore untill then <hi>Quirinius</hi> was not Preſident of <hi>Syria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is in very good Authours mention made of an old Monument of Stone recording the famous deedes of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> wherein theſe three taxings are recorded: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though age hath ſomewhat eaten into it, and in certaine places worne out ſome pieces of the words, yet it well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that the Middle taxing was about the Conſulſhip of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115738:109"/>one whoſe name was <hi>Aſinius.</hi> For when the Monument ſpeaketh of that Taxing, although ſome of the letters be wanting, yet we finde <hi>ſinio Coſ.</hi> By which is meant <hi>Aſinio Coſ.</hi> That is, <hi>Aſinius</hi> being Conſul: for if the letter A. be put to <hi>ſinio,</hi> it will upon neceſſity be ſo. And indeed where was there a Conſul, or what was his name who had that termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but <hi>Aſinius?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well, but what <hi>Aſinius</hi> was this? In the 38. <hi>Iulian</hi> yeare we finde one called by the name of <hi>Cajus Aſinius Gallus,</hi> who was then Conſul with <hi>Cajus Martius Cenſorinus:</hi> After whom there was none of that name Conſul til after <hi>Herod</hi> was dead. This then declareth that here was the beginning of that tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, within the compaſſe whereof Chriſt was born. For firſt, though <hi>Dion</hi> omitteth to tell us in what year this Middle Taxing was, yet doth his ſilence hinder nothing; for by theſe Characters we find it. Secondly this was the fifth year after the Conſulſhip of <hi>Quirinius.</hi> And thirdly, we find a paſſage in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> by which we are pointed to the dayes of <hi>Sentius Saturnius:</hi> which is not impertinent. For Saint <hi>Luke</hi> doth not ſay that our Saviours birth was under the taxing made by <hi>Cyrenius,</hi> but rather that <hi>Cyrenius</hi> firſt began the taxing, or that it was firſt made whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Preſident of <hi>Syria.</hi> To which <hi>Suidas</hi> well accordeth, ſaying; <hi>Auguſtus</hi> obtaining a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, appointed twenty men of honeſt life and converſation, whom he ſent throughout his Provinces to tax the people &amp; their ſubſtances, of which they were to give an account in publick: and this he firſt began when <hi>Quirinius,</hi> or (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> calleth him) <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Preſident of <hi>Syria.</hi> By all which it well appeareth, that as this Taxing began in ſome part of the 38 <hi>Julian</hi> year, ſo it was depending and not ended untill the 42 <hi>Julian</hi> year, which was the 28 year of the <hi>Actium</hi> fight, &amp; the year next after the birth of Chriſt. For if the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his fourth book and 19 Chapter, againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> formerly mentioned, be underſtood otherwiſe, it muſt needs claſh with the holy Scripture: which upon ſuch termes may by no meanes be admitted.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth this hitherto mentioned, concerning the year of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115738:109"/>Chriſts birth, but agree well with the time of the ſlaughter of the Innocents at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and the parts thereabouts; which (as appeareth by Scripture) was in the ſecond year after either the conception or birth of Chriſt: For <hi>Herod</hi> having inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red diligently of the Wiſe men at what time the Star appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, was punctually informed of the time thereof: and thereupon when (a little before his death) he put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe his bloody purpoſe of ſlaying the infants, he ſlew them who were of two years old and under, according to the time that he had diligently inquired of the Wiſe-men, who came not to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the ſecond year after Chriſt was born, but in the ſame year, even before the day of <hi>Maries</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification. For firſt, when they came, they inquired for Chriſt under the notion of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: which word properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is to be underſtood of a child newly born, and is ſo uſed to expreſſe the birth of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.23. Secondly, when in the forme of their inquiry they ſay, Where is he that is born King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> it is more properly to be undeſtood of a King lately born, then of one born ſome certaine years before. Thirdly, when they made this inquiry, all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was troubled as at ſome new thing, of which they had heard nothing before: whereas at the time of the Purification he was proclaimed openly in the Temple, where were enough to take notice of him, and to ſpread the fame thereof abroad to others. Then did good old <hi>Simeon</hi> take him up in his armes, and hold him forth as the glory of Gods people <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> becauſe he was born among them: and likewiſe as a light to lighten the Gentiles, becauſe in theſe Wiſemen he ſhewed them the way unto him. Fourthly and laſtly, when the Wiſemen came, they found him at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where he was not to be found after the time of his mothers Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for (as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> telleth us) after his parents had in that duty of theirs, performed all things according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into <hi>Galilee,</hi> to their owne City <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that is, They went bach againe

                     <p>Well, but though the comming of the Wiſemen was while <hi>Mary</hi> lay in at <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> yet (as I ſaid before) the ſlaughter of the Infants was not untill the ſecond year after the Star appeared, as is plaine out of the Text, telling us of what age they were that <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew;

But what Policy <hi>Herod</hi> might have in deferring the execution of his purpoſe thus long, I cannot eaſily perceive: he was politicke enough we ſee when he went about it, and might have ſome politicke end propounded to himſelfe too, why he would not doe it preſently after he ſaw that he was mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Wiſemen, though it be not laid open for every eye to diſcerne. But be his policy herein what it would, I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there was an over-ruling Providence that went along with it, and was as much unknown to <hi>Herod,</hi> as was the cauſe,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115738:110"/>why <hi>Herod</hi> deferred the ſlaughter unknown to others. For the longer it was before <hi>Mary</hi> was forced to fly with her childe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> the more was their ſtrength and fitneſſe for ſuch a journy: nor could their ſtay there be overlong, if they went but late, and ſo be the better able to endure the hardſhip of a ſtrange Country. <hi>Sabellicus</hi> ſaith that <hi>Herod</hi> was neceſſitated to defer this ſlaughter thus long, by reaſon that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there to purge himſelfe before <hi>Ceſar</hi> of thoſe accuſations which his owne Sons brought againſt him; which is not unlike: untill therefore he had done that, and was come back againe, he could not ſlay theſe Innocents. But that being done, and he come home againe, his anger which he had before conceived againſt the Wiſemen for mocking him, and his purpoſe to murther Chriſt for feare he ſhould get his Kingdome from him, put him upon the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Maſſacre.</p>
                     <p>And thus I doubt not but I have found out the right year of our Saviours birth; which was the 41 <hi>Julian</hi> year, the 33 year of <hi>Herod,</hi> the 40 year of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the fourth year of the 193 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4709, and year of World 4000.

                     </p>
                     <p>And thus I have ſhewed not only the year of Chriſts birth, but alſo the year and day of his baptiſme, being baptized (as the Church by tradition generally holdeth) on the ſixth day of <hi>January,</hi> in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4742. and yeare of the World 4032.</p>
                     <p>That which is next, concernes the day of his birth: in the ſearching after which, the authorities of the Ancients will be conſiderable, though for the yeare they were at odds and could helpe us little. For when they ſpeake of the yeare, they delivered but matter of opinion; but in this they ſpeake
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115738:112"/>matter of practiſe, which is to be regarded before the private fancies of later times.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IF the authority of <hi>Clement</hi> (in the fifth book and 12 chapter of his <hi>Apoſtolicall Conſtitutions</hi>) might paſſe for granted, we ſhould have a teſtimony as ancient as the very times of the Apoſtles, to ſhew that then and in thoſe dayes, the Birth day of our Saviour was obſerved.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe many learned men make queſtion whether thoſe <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> were ever any of his, I ſhall rather alleage a teſtimony out of the firſt book and ſixth chapter of the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiatours</hi> or <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> wherein is ſaid; That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and other Chriſtians, as they uſed other things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, ſo alſo they freely uſed Feaſts. Which teſtimony ought the rather to be regarded, becauſe the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe hath ſaid; <hi>Chriſt our Paſſeover is Sacrificed for us;</hi> therefore (ſaith he) let us keepe the Feaſt: as is written, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. Which words doe confirme the teſtimony before mentioned, and is alſo an evidence to convince them of errour, who would have Chriſtians keep no Feaſt dayes at all: no, not ſo much as a day in honour to Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour of the World.</p>
                     <p>The Ancients were of another minde: they therefore kept ſuch a day. And in the Greek or Eaſterne Church they called it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>: which ſignifieth in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, God's appearing. And indeed when Chriſt was born, God appeared to the World by the Nativity of his ſonne. Which is but what the Apoſtle ſheweth: for ſpeaking to <hi>Timothy</hi> of the Incarnation of Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, thus he ſaith; It was God manifeſted in the fleſh,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115738:112"/>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And if God manifeſted in the fleſh, then may the day thereof, in that reſpect, be fitly called <hi>Theophania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Latine or Weſterne Church called it <hi>Dies Nativitatis;</hi> the day of the Nativity: <hi>Dies natalis Domini, vel Natalitia Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini;</hi> The Birth day of our Lord; agreeing therein to that of the Angel in <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. <hi>Behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy which ſhall be to all people: For unto you is borne this day, in the City of</hi> David, <hi>a Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The newes then we ſee came firſt from heaven: an Angel brought the firſt tidings of the Day; by whom it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be a day of great joy to all people. <hi>And therefore</hi> (to ſhew men what they ſhould doe) <hi>there was ſuddenly with the Angel a multitude of the Heavenly hoſt praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men,</hi> Luke 2.13.14. Which very <hi>Hymne</hi> was afterwards by <hi>Teleſphorus</hi> (who was Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in the year after Chriſt's Paſſion 107) ordained to be ſung in the Church on the Eve alwayes of Chriſts Nativity;

But whether it were or no, it was ancient: And ſo all things conſidered, it well appeareth, that though the ſinging of this <hi>Hymne</hi> was but then appointed to be uſed in the Church, yet the Day (on whoſe Eve it was appointed to be Sung) was obſerved and kept before; yea even in the times of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, if <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> may be credited, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</p>

                        <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was much about the ſame time with <hi>Theophilus:</hi>

                           <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 195</note> and in him mention is made of ſome, who being more curius then others, perſwaded themſelves that Chriſt's Birth Day was either on the 25 day of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> moneth <hi>Pharmuth</hi> (which anſwereth, the moſt part of it, to <hi>April</hi>) or on the 25 of <hi>Phacon,</hi> which anſwereth in like manner to <hi>May.</hi> For, <hi>Sunt qui curioſius</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>natali Domini non ſolum annum ſed etiam diem aſſignant.</hi> In which words, ſaying, <hi>Sunt qui curioſius:</hi> me thinks it is but as if he ſhould barely relate the opinion of ſome, whom the ordinary Day obſerved would not content: for they being more curious then others, ſearch after another day; and that muſt be either in the moneth <hi>Pharmuth</hi> or <hi>Phacon:</hi> but in which of theſe, they were at a ſtand. Thus it may be in any thing elſe, though never ſo certainly known: for what is there which may not be either queſtioned or contradicted by ſuch as are either ignorant, wilfull, or have an affectation of ſingularity? <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi> ſaith well concerning the ground of this errour, that it was becauſe they reckoned the ſixth Moneth (in which the Angel was ſent unto the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>) not from the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, but from the beginning of the Hebrew year which began from <hi>Niſan</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> near the vernall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox: from whence the ſixth Moneth is

For the Angel <hi>Gabrel</hi> doth directly ſay, This is the ſixth Moneth (not from the beginning of the year, but) with her who was called barren; that is from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.36.</p>

                     <p>Theſe are the teſtimonies of the Ancients,
<note place="margin">A new: opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaldus, Anno Dom.</hi> 1577.</note> according whereunto the ſucceeding ages of the Church (both before and ſince the Reformation) have preciſely and exactly wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. And yet let me not forget that ſome of late yeares have ſtrove to introduce a new opinion, not once ſo much as drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of untill <hi>Beroaldus</hi> publiſhed his booke of ſtrange Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115738:114"/>which was not untill the yeare of our Lord 1577. This new opinion is, that Chriſt ſhould be borne in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> or when the Sun entring into <hi>Libra</hi> made the ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scaliger</hi> had done well if he had confuted it: but he, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his Scholler <hi>Calviſius,</hi> endeavoured the contrary, adding their ſtrength to uphold it, although upon as weake grounds as he that firſt ſet it abroach.</p>
                     <p>The beſt argument that they have, is built upon the courſes of the Prieſts, which <hi>Beroaldus</hi> accounteth from their firſt time in the dayes of King <hi>David,</hi> and beginneth at <hi>Joarib;</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe there were 24 courſes in all, that therefore two Courſes were appointed for every Moneth. And indeed <hi>Joaribs</hi> Courſe was the firſt of all the Courſes, which <hi>Beroaldus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth in <hi>March,</hi> and without any reſpect at all to any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, continueth his account from thence ever after. But this is ſtrange: for not only were the Courſes interrupted, but even the beginning of them is fixed by him in an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time; unleſſe he were ſure that it was in <hi>March</hi> when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> firſt appointed them: of which I am ſure he neither was nor could be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scaliger</hi> alſo begins at <hi>Joarib,</hi> and accounteth but from the time when the Courſes of the Prieſts were reſtored by <hi>Judas Macchabeus</hi> in the 148. year of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> on the 25 day of <hi>Caſleu;</hi> thinking becauſe the Shewbread was changed every Sabbath day in the morning, that therefore every Courſe had but his weeke of Service. Which for the time of their ſervice is probable enough, and may be granted; as may be ſeen in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.7. and in 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 23.4. But why, when <hi>Iudas</hi> purged the Temple, and reſtored the Courſes, <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſhould then begin his account at <hi>Ioarib,</hi> without any proofe at all to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it, is altogether as uncertain as at the firſt to begin them in <hi>March.</hi> For who knoweth but <hi>Iudas</hi> might reſtore them ſo, as they began againe (at the time when he reſtored them) where they were interrupted and broken off by <hi>Anciochus:</hi> and at whoſe Courſe that was, is no where recorded by any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:115738:115"/>
                     <p>Nor will the Kalender of the Courſes, ſet forth by Maſter <hi>Lightfoot</hi> in his Harmony of the foure Evangeliſts, ſerve the turn. For [firſt] it is but upon conjecture that he beginneth the firſt Courſe on the next Sabbath day after the Feaſt of Tabernacles. Secondly, by making the Courſes keepe their conſtant round in ſuch order as he accounts them, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Courſe of <hi>Bilgah</hi> (which was the fifteenth Courſe) to be in that part of the fifth Month, where ſhould be the Courſe of <hi>Ioarib:</hi> For when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> deſtroyed the firſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> it was (as the <hi>Iewes</hi> beare witneſſe) the watch or Courſe of <hi>Ioarib.</hi> Now the Courſe of <hi>Ioarib</hi> was not the fifteenth, but the firſt Courſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.7. Thirdly, he makes the Courſe of <hi>Gamul,</hi> in the end of the ſixth Moneth, to have but foure dayes: which ſhould have ſeven as well as the reſt. And laſt of all were his Kalender perfect, it could be ſo but for one yeare; becauſe that day of the Moneth which is Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day in this year, will not be ſo in the next: which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the three weeks of the there great Feaſts (in which he telleth us there was no diſtinct courſe that ſerved, but all the Courſes ſerved indifferently together) will make a great and manifeſt alteration every year.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore the beſt and only way to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe Courſes by accounting them backe from the time that the ſecond Temple was deſtroyed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> at which time was the weeke and Courſe of <hi>Ioarib;</hi> as is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by the <hi>Iews,</hi> in their ancient Chronicle called <hi>Seder Olam rabba.</hi> For ſeeing the Courſes were interrupted often before the dayes of <hi>Iudas Maccabeus,</hi> but never after till the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Temple by the <hi>Romans,</hi> there can be no better way then to account back from thence. And ſo doing, I finde that <hi>Ioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribs</hi> Courſe, in the fortieth <hi>Iulian</hi> yeare (the yeare that the Baptiſt was conceived) began on the fourteenth day of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> which was the nine and twentieth day of the fifth Month, <hi>feria ſeptima.</hi> And <hi>Ioaribs</hi> Courſe beginning then, <hi>Abijah's</hi> Courſe (to which <hi>Zacharias</hi> belonged) muſt needes begin on
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115738:115"/>the ſecond day of <hi>October,</hi> which was the nineteenth day of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Moneth <hi>foria ſeptima.</hi> on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> was the laſt day of this Courſe: at the night wherof, or on the night after when the Sabbath was ended (which we know was but from Even to Even) the Baptiſt was conceved, and born 258 dayes after, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>Iune</hi> in the 41 <hi>Iulian</hi> year. And note that this is the ſooneſt time for a Child to be borne in a birth that is ordinary. For in ordinary births (and ſuch this was, <hi>Luke</hi> 157.) carried on according to the courſe of Nature, the continuance of the infant in the Mothers Womb dependeth much upon the place of the Moone at the time of the conception, as they know who are any thing at all acquainted with <hi>Hermes</hi> his <hi>Trutina,</hi> in which may be ſeen, that as the ſhorteſt time is 258. dayes; ſo the middle time is 273. dayes, and the longeſt time is 288. dayes. Now Chriſt's time of abode in the Virgins Womb was neither of the longeſt time, nor of the ſhorteſt time,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 1.36.</note> but much about the middle time. For in the ſixth Moneth after the Baptiſts conception, (<hi>viz.</hi> five Moneths and nineteene dayes) our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt was conceived, on the 25 day of <hi>March,</hi> in the 41 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, which in that year was the
<note n="*" place="margin">And was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</note> ſeventeenth day of the firſt Moneth. From whence to the
<note n="*" place="margin">The day of his birth was on the ſecond day of the weeke even as he himſelfe was the ſecond Perſon of the holy Trinity: and as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of the weeke, ſo the 27 day of the tenth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. <hi>Beroald.</hi> in his Chrono. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</note> day of his birth were 275. dayes compleat, as many as are from the 25. of <hi>March</hi> to the 25 of <hi>December.</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> nameth 276 dayes, which muſt be underſtood of ſo many dayes current: for ſo long Chriſt remained in the Virgins Wombe as the Church (ſaith he) had it by tradition. <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Trin. cap. ult.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as for that which <hi>Beroaldus</hi> hath further concerning the Indictions which began on the 24 of <hi>September,</hi> and were inſtituted to beare account of the payment of tribute, it is an argument very abſurd. For when Chriſt was born, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions were not known, but were inſtituted above 300 years after, at which time they were invented, even in the ſeventh year of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, and in the year of the common <hi>Aera</hi> of Chriſt's birth 312. Why ſhould they therefore be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged to ſhew the times of Chriſt's birth? Becauſe (ſaith <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaldus</hi>)
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115738:116"/>they concerned the Taxes and Tributes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and beginning on the 24 day of <hi>September,</hi> they ſhew that to be the day of Chriſts birth, when the decree went forth from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> that all the World ſhould be taxed. This is ſtrange, and more abſurd ſtill then before: For if the iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of <hi>Ceſars</hi> Decree and our Savious birth were on one and the ſame day, then muſt the Decree fly above a thouſand miles in one day; as far as from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Nazareth:</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that (in the ſame day ſtill, <hi>Mary</hi> muſt travell with <hi>Joſeph</hi> about 95 miles, before ſhe be delivered; even as far as from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> By which cluſter of abſurdities all men may ſee that <hi>Beroaldus</hi> might have been better adviſed then to uſe this as an argument to prove Chriſts birth to be on the 24 day of <hi>September.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As weake alſo is that objection concerning the Shepherds keeping watch over their Flocks by night, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.8. For the temperature of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in the dead of Winter, is nothing like the Winter in our cold Northerne Countries, but warme enough for their Cattell to lye abroad, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for the Shepheards to keepe watch over their Floks by night. For there, in that Country, they began their Harveſt at Eaſter in the Moneth of <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Niſan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

This alſo <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſheweth in the third book of his <hi>Antiquities</hi> at the tenth Chapter: and <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> in the <hi>Prologomena</hi> to his <hi>Harmony,</hi> Chapter the third. Their Winter therefore muſt needs be far warmer then Winter is with us: which even the ſituation of their Country, both in reſpect of the Longitude and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that it hath, declareth. As for Longitude, it is placed betwixt the degree 64, 32 minutes, and the degree 69, and ten minutes: And as for the Latitude or Elevation, it is found to extend it ſelfe from the degree 30, and 52 minutes, unto the degree 33, and 44 minutes. So that all things conſidered, their Sheep were not onely abroad in Winter when Chriſt was born, but might alſo have young Lambs, for the ſafety
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115738:116"/>whereof the Shepheards were watching over their Flocks by night. For even we our ſelves, in our cold Countries, have ſeen young Lambs in <hi>December,</hi> as cannot be denied.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore, that there is no juſt cauſe (for any thing that can be alledged againſt it) why we ſhould depart from the ancient and received opinion of Chriſts birth on the 25 day of <hi>December.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>TAcitus,</hi> in the 15 Book of the tenth Chapter of his <hi>Annals,</hi> ſpeaking of the Chriſtians, ſaith: The Authour of that name was Chriſt, who in <hi>Tiberius</hi> reigne was put to death under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> Procuratour of <hi>Iudaea.</hi> But in what year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> or <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> he doth not ſhew.</p>
                     <p>Some I finde who would have the beginning of <hi>Tiberius</hi> be before the death of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> and ſo would have then two Emperours to reigne at once: for which they chiefly build upon the teſtimony of <hi>Velleius,</hi> who ſaith that before <hi>Auguſtus</hi> dyed <hi>Tiberius</hi> was equalled with him in command. But to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the reigne of <hi>Tiberius</hi> upon this miſtaken ground, is to unjoynt the ſetled times, and make old Authours ſpeak that which they never meant. For (as <hi>Petavius</hi> well obſerveth) the Proconſular dignity was given without the Empire: and never were two men Emperours together till <hi>Aurelius Antonius</hi> his time. And therefore though <hi>Tiberius</hi> was equalled in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſome time before <hi>Auguſtus</hi> dyed, yet it was but in ſome things; which dignity was beſtowed upon him not as Emperour, but as he was a gallant Generall over the Army, and like to be the next ſucceeding Emperour. This, even <hi>Velleius</hi> ſheweth, who accounts but 16 years from the beginning of <hi>Tiberius</hi> as Emperour, to the Conſulſhip of M. <hi>Vinitius</hi> and C. <hi>Caſſius:</hi> the ſeventeenth year therefore of his reigne began in the time of their Conſulſhip, which was in the 75 <hi>Iulian</hi> year. <hi>Tacitus</hi> declaring moreover, not onely how loath <hi>Tiberius</hi> was (which alſo <hi>Velleius</hi> ſheweth) to take the Empire upon him when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was dead; but alſo how fearfull his Mother <hi>Livia</hi> was, leſt any other ſhould get into
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115738:120"/>the Empire before him. This againe may be ſeen in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> by the tenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> for when <hi>Tiberius</hi> had reigned nine years, then was C. <hi>Aſinius</hi> and C. <hi>Antiſtius</hi> the Conſuls; <hi>viz.</hi> in the 68 <hi>Iulian</hi> year. The beginning therefore of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> is certaine, and may not be ſet either here or there, as men upon falſe perſwaſions ſhall be pleaſed; but muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted from the death of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and no ſooner. For though it were uſuall among the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> to have their years accounted from ſuch time as they began to be Co-part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with their Fathers in the Empire; as <hi>Cieſias,</hi> compared with other Authors, maketh manifeſt; and as was alſo among the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael:</hi> yet that it was ſo among the <hi>Romans,</hi> or that two were Emperours together till <hi>Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Antonius</hi> his time, we doe not finde. Now <hi>Auguſtus</hi> we know dyed (as <hi>Velleius, Dion,</hi> and all others teſtifie) when <hi>Sextus Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>Sextus Appuleius</hi> were Conſuls, on the nineteenth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the 59 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 47 27: there therefore we muſt begin the firſt year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> who reigned 22 years, ſeven moneths, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes; and dyed when Cn. <hi>Proculus</hi> and <hi>Pontius Nigrinus</hi> were Conſuls, on the 26 day of <hi>March,</hi> in the 82 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4750. By which it appeareth that the Paſſion of Chriſt muſt neceſſarily be in ſome year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the 74 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and before the 82.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>Oroſius</hi> his account it muſt be in the 75 <hi>Iulian</hi> year. For <hi>Sejanus</hi> periſhed in the 76 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, as cannot be denied: &amp; according to <hi>Oroſius</hi> Chriſt muſt ſuffer before the fall of <hi>Seja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> For, in his ſeventh Book and fourth Chapter, we read, That when <hi>Tiberius</hi> had heard what <hi>Pilate</hi> related to him of the Death and Reſurrection of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and that thereupon <hi>Tiberius</hi> would that the Senate ſhould Canonize Chriſt for a God, the Senate would not but ſtood againſt it, and ſo (ſaith he) did <hi>Sejanus,</hi> who ſhewed himſelfe a great enemy to the Chriſtian profeſſion: whereupon it came to paſſe that an Edict was made for the rooting of all Chriſtians out of the City. Thus ſaith <hi>Oroſius:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by him, Chriſt muſt ſuffer not one jot later then the 75
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115738:121"/>
                        <hi>Iulian</hi> year, in the year of the <hi>Iulian Perion</hi> 4743, when M. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi> and C. <hi>Caſſius</hi> were Conſuls: in whoſe Conſulſhip, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius</hi> alſo ſetteth Chriſts Paſſion. But this is falſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not onely by the ſeverall Paſſeovers mentioned by Saint <hi>John</hi> after Chriſts Baptiſme, to the day of his death, but alſo by the ſilence of other Authours. And therefore the teſtimonies of <hi>Oroſius</hi> concerning <hi>Sejanus</hi> cannot ſtand good, for being a matter of ſtory, he muſt have it from them who wrote before him, but that he hath not. For <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes no mention of it, nor <hi>Euſebius:</hi> and yet they ſpeak how <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> would have had Chriſt Canonized for a God by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, when <hi>Pilate</hi> had related to him the Paſſion and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt. I finde indeed that <hi>Sejanus</hi> (like another <hi>Haman</hi>) did earneſtly endeavour and deſire it of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> might be rooted out; as <hi>Euſebius</hi> relateth out of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew:</hi> And from hence ſure it was that <hi>Oroſius</hi> miſtook himſelfe, and applyed that to the Chriſtians after Chriſts Paſſion, which was perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſts Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, Chriſt was baptized in the twelfth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and crucified in the fifteenth when the two <hi>Gemini</hi> were Conſuls: this was in the 74<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                        <hi>Julian</hi> year. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> maketh Chriſt about 29 years old when he was baptized, and nameth <hi>Iunius Silanus</hi> and <hi>Silius Nerva</hi> to be Conſuls then; which was one year ſooner then the Conſulſhips of the <hi>Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni:</hi> which two <hi>Gemini,</hi> albeit they were Conſuls but in the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> are ſaid not onely by <hi>Teriullian,</hi> but by <hi>Iulius Africanus, Lactantius,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtine, Sulpitius, Cedrenus</hi> and others, to be Conſuls when Chriſt was crucified. This I beleeve they took up from what <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> held before them: for it was the opinion of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Strom.</hi> 1. that Chriſt lived fifteene years under <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and as many under <hi>Tiberius;</hi> in all 30: In the laſt whereof he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſuffered. For which opinion he had none before him that he followed but the <hi>Gnoſtickes,</hi> and no other then a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken ground to uphold it. His ground was in <hi>Eſay,</hi> chap. 61.2. Concerning the Acceptable year of the Lord which
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115738:121"/>Chriſt was to preach. Which I ſay was a miſtaken ground: For though it be true that Chriſt indeed proclaimed that year in the ſence that the Prophet meant it, and in the firſt year after his Baptiſme when he preached at <hi>Nazareth</hi> ſhewed that it was come, as we read in <hi>Luke</hi> 4.19. Yet that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preached but one year, is ſuch an extreame miſtake, that it is a wonder any who had read the Goſpels, ſhould not ſee to avoid it. <hi>Origen erred</hi> much after the ſame manner: for <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <gap reason="foreign">

Which words <hi>John</hi> ſpake after there had been one Paſſeover ſince the Baptiſme of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.23. Beſide which, the ſame Evangeliſt expreſly nameth two more; the laſt whereof was that in which Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, as may be ſeen in <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.4. and chap. 13.1. But of the Paſſeovers more ſhall be ſpoken by and by.</p>
                     <p>Among late Writers the greateſt part goe along with <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> who maketh choice of the eighteenth year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> for the year of Chriſts Paſſion. <hi>Scaliger</hi> (more rightly) is for the nineteenth year, and year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4746. <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> ſaith Chriſt was baptized in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4742, and crucified in the year of the ſame <hi>Period</hi> 4744, even in the third Paſſover after his Baptiſme: for he was baptized on the ſixth day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith. And as for the day of his Paſſion, he referreth it to the 23 day of <hi>March:</hi> therein following <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> lib. 2. cap. 38. <hi>Apollinaris</hi> of <hi>Laodicea apud Hieron,</hi> in 9. Dan. <hi>Origen,</hi> cap. 2. <hi>cont. Celſ. Epiphanius, Haereſ.</hi> 51. Which alſo a Councell held at <hi>Caeſaria, Anno Dom.</hi> 197, under <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> declareth. The 23 day of <hi>March</hi> was indeed in that year which <hi>Petavius</hi> mentioneth on the ſixth day of the Week, but the Paſſeover was not untill three or four dayes after: and therefore how could Chriſt ſuffer on the 23 day of <hi>March</hi> in the year of the <hi>Iulian Pe.</hi> 4744.</p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:115738:122"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scaliger</hi> is for the third of <hi>Aprill:</hi> and <hi>Paulus Foroſemproni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis</hi> for the thirtieth of <hi>March,</hi> in the ſix and thirtieth year of Chriſt, according to the common account, even whileſt the 22 year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> was ſtill running on, which was in the 81 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4749, when Q. <hi>Plauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Sextus Papinius</hi> were Conſuls. This laſt is taken up by Maſter <hi>Lydyat,</hi> and mainely defended by him: but all in vaine.</p>
                     <p>For not only was Chriſt crucifyed whilſt <hi>Tiberius</hi> was alive, but alſo whilſt <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was in office. Now <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was certainly out of office before the Eaſter of the eighty firſt <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and therefore that could not be the year of Chriſts Paſſion. For as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſheweth, <hi>Vitellius</hi> came into <hi>Syria</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>viz.</hi> when C. <hi>Cestius</hi> and M <hi>Servilius</hi> were Conſuls, <hi>Taci. lib.</hi> 6.</note> eightieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year: before whom <hi>Pilate</hi> was accuſed, and was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to defend his cauſe before the Eaſter of that year in which <hi>Vitellius</hi> was at <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> as appeareth out of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> in the eighteenth book of his <hi>Antiquities,</hi> at the fifth and ſixth Chapters. Before which time of his being ſent away, he had been Preſident of <hi>Iudaea</hi> ten whole years, and did ſucceed in that office <hi>Valerius Gratus</hi> whom <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſoon after the beginning of his Empire, at the death of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſent to rule and governe that Province, which he did for the ſpace of eleven years; as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> againe declareth. Take then eleven of <hi>Gratus,</hi> and ten of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and add them each to other, ſo we have 21 years. Which one and twenty being added to the 59 <hi>Iulian</hi> year, in the latter part whereof <hi>Tiberius</hi> began, will make it appeare that <hi>Pilate</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his Province in the end of the eightieth <hi>Iulian</hi> year; or however, before the Eaſter of the eighty firſt. For <hi>Vitellius,</hi> after he had commanded <hi>Pilate</hi> to goe away to <hi>Rome,</hi> and had ſet <hi>Marcellus</hi> over his Province, came to the ſolemne feaſt of the
<note n="*" place="margin">This was in the 81. <hi>Jul an</hi> yeare, when <hi>Quint. Plauii.</hi> and <hi>Sex. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinius</hi> were Conſuls.</note> Paſſeover at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and gave leave to the chief Prieſts to keep the holy Robe, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> alſo ſheweth. After which time he received letters from <hi>Tiberius</hi> of making peace with <hi>Artabanus:</hi> which he did, and wrote thereof to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> But <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch</hi> prevented his intelligence, and had wrote of all to the Emperour before him: Whereupon <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:115738:122"/>wrote back againe to <hi>Vitellius</hi> that he knew all the whole buſineſſe already, having had notice thereof by the Letters of <hi>Herod.</hi> Now theſe things being thus certified each to other after Eaſter, could not be done in the eighty ſecond <hi>Julian</hi> yeare: for before the Eaſter of that year <hi>Tiberius</hi> died. And if not in the eighty ſecond <hi>Julian</hi> year, then muſt they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be done in the year before; <hi>viz.</hi> in the 81. And if in the eighty firſt, then could not that be the year of Chriſt's paſſion: for at the Eaſter time of that year when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſuffered, Pilate was in full power; which made him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay, <hi>Knoweſt thou not that I have Power to Crucifie thee, and have Power to releaſe thee? Ioh.</hi> 19.10. This he ſpake in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty eight <hi>Julian</hi> year, about two yeares before he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Province, as will eaſily appear to him who computeth the times aright, and as I ſhall after ſhew more fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to every eye.</p>
                     <p>For by the Paſſovers already mentioned out of the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is moſt plainly manifeſt that the firſt yeare wherein we can but thinke of ſearching for our Saviours Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, muſt be the 76 <hi>Iulian</hi> yeare: for the three Paſſovers in Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> after the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> when Chriſt was baptized, will certainly reach thither. That yeare therefore is the firſt year wherin we muſt ſearch: and if upon the ſearch we can find that the fifteenth day of <hi>Niſan</hi> falleth on the ſixth day of the weeke, then may that be the year of his Paſſion, and the Paſſovers after his Baptiſme till his death be no more then three. But upon the ſearch, the fifteenth day of <hi>Niſan</hi> in that yeare is found to be on the third day of the weeke: that therefore could not be the yeare, nor thoſe the juſt number of the Paſſovers. For though Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> hath clearly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioned but three, yet for all that we are not tyed from ſearching after more. For as it is certaine that all things which Jeſus did are not written: ſo alſo it is as certaine that all things which are written of him in the Goſpels, are not recorded by one Evangeliſt.</p>
                     <p>And again why I name the fifteenth day of <hi>Niſan</hi> (when the Paſſover was kept) to be on the ſixth day of the weeke
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115738:123"/>at Chriſts Paſſion, is becauſe he aroſe from the dead on the firſt day of the week, and on the third day after his death. That it was on the firſt day of the Week, is manifeſt by all the four Evagneliſts, chiefly by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Marke,</hi> in his 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chap. at the ninth verſe. And that it was likewiſe on the third day after his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is as manifeſt by a whole multitude of Scriptures. As for example, in <hi>Matthew</hi> 16.21. from that time forth began Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to ſhew unto his Diſciples, how that he muſt goe into <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and ſuffer many things of the Elders and chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and be killed, and be raiſed againe the third day. And in the next Chapter at the 23. verſe, they ſhall kill him, and the third day he ſhall be raiſed againe. And in the 20 Chapter at the nineteenth verſe, They ſhall deliver him to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to mocke, and to ſcourge, and to curcifie him, and the third day he ſhall riſe again. And in <hi>Marke</hi> 9.31. he taught his Diſciples, and ſaid unto them. The Sonne of man is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into the hands of men, and they ſhall kill him, and after that he is killed, he ſhall riſe the third day. And in the next Chapter, at the 34 verſe: They ſhall mocke him, and ſhall ſcourge him, and ſhall ſpit upon him, and ſhall kill him, and the third day he ſhall riſe againe. And in <hi>Luke</hi> 9.22. The Son of man muſt ſuffer many things, and be rejected of the Elders, and chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and be ſlaine, and be raiſed the third day. And in the eighteenth Chapter at the 33. verſe. They ſhall ſcourge him and put him to death, and the third day he ſhall riſe againe. And in the four and twentieth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at the ſeventeenth verſe, The Son of Man muſt be delivered into the hands of Sinfull men, and be crucified, and the third day riſe again. And in <hi>Act.</hi> 10.40. Him God raiſed up the third day, and ſhewed him openly. And in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4. That he was buried, and that he roſe againe the third day according to the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>In which laſt Teſtimony note I pray you, not only what the Apoſtle maintaineth, but how; namely; That the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Chriſt from the dead on the third day, is according to the Scriptures. If there be any text of Scripture which at the firſt fight may ſeeme to ſay, Chriſt roſe not till after the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115738:123"/>third day, it is to admit of an interpretation, that thereby it may be like the other Scriptures. As for example, in <hi>Marke</hi> 8.31. the phraſe is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

As it ſhould be ſaid, They ſhall put him to death, and within three dayes he ſhall riſe again. Now this appeareth by <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.28. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Deut</hi> 26.12. A like phraſe is in <hi>Luke</hi> 2.46. as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text declareth.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, which we muſt not tranſlate, After Supper; but <hi>inter coenandum,</hi> whilſt they were at Supper. 'The Phariſees alſo who told <hi>Pilat</hi> what Chriſt would doe after his three dayes, underſtood the Phraſe but of the third day: for no longer did they deſire that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher ſhould be watched, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.63. And indeed Chriſt had ſaid the ſame before in words plain enough: for ſaith he, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and within three dayes I wil raiſe it up, Iohn</hi> 2.19. This is that time to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Prophet pointed, when he ſaid; After two dayes he will revive us, in the third day he will raiſe us up, &amp; we ſhall live in his ſight, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.2. Vpon which words one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth this; <hi>vivificat nos poſt duos dies, &amp; tertio die eriget, ut vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamus coram ipſo: quia in Chriſto &amp; cum Chriſto pater caelestis nos nipote membra Chriſti ex mortuis ſuſcitavit, Epheſ.</hi> 2.5.6. By which we ſee that the Reſurrection is certainely bounded within the compaſſe of three dayes, and not to be expected afterward.</p>
                     <p>The onely place remaining to be objected againſt it, is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.40. where our Saviour ſaith; As <hi>Jonas</hi> was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly, ſo muſt the Son of Man be three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth. Which words are alſo to be interpreted; they agree not elſe to the other Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Know therefore that by three dayes and three nights, we are to underſtand three naturall dayes, accounted from Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Evening; as the <hi>Jews</hi> uſe to reckon; in which reſpect the day and the night are confounded, and both of them made but one. By the three dayes then and the three nights, we are
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115738:124"/>(I ſay) to underſtand three ſuch days, in the laſt wher of Chriſt aroſe: for by a <hi>Senecdoche</hi> we reckon that done after three dayes, which is done but after the third day is begun. The firſt of theſe three dayes was the ſixth day of the Weeke, and the fifteenth day of <hi>Niſan,</hi> and was from one Sun-ſetting to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. For before the fifteenth day of <hi>Niſan</hi> was quite out, Chriſt was crucified dead and buried. The ſecond day began at the Sunſetting next after, during which time was the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>The third and laſt began at the end of the former, and was the firſt day of the weeke: in the morning whereof very early Chriſt aroſe; And all this according to the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>But I go on, and am to ſearch next into the 77 <hi>Iulian</hi> year; at the Eaſter whereof muſt be a fourth Paſſover ſince Chriſts Baptiſme: which if it be found to fall on the Sixth day of the weeke, may be the year of his Paſſion. But I finde it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for in the 77 <hi>Iulian</hi> year the fifteenth of <hi>Niſan</hi> was on the firſt or ſecond day of the weeke, and not on the Sixth day. This therefore could not be the year of Chriſts Paſſion, no more then the former.</p>
                     <p>The year next after this was the 78. <hi>Iulian</hi> yeare, and year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4746. which will be found to be the very year we ſeeke after. For in this year the fifteenth of <hi>Niſan</hi> was for certaine on the Sixth day of the week, being the third day of <hi>April</hi> and day of the fifth Paſſover which is mentioned by all the four Evangeliſts, not one of them omitting it. The yeare that followeth, affordeth no ſuch Character: no, nor the year next after that. This therefore muſt needs be the year of Chriſts death; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being in this year, was on the third day of <hi>Aprill:</hi> the Cycle of the Sun was 14, the Dominicall letter D. and the Cycle of the Moon 15. It was the nineteenth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the fourth yeare of the 202. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 33 yeare of Chriſt according to the common account: but according to the true time of his birth, the ſeven and thirtieth; and yeare of the World 4037.</p>
                     <p>And thus we have no fewer then five Paſſovers from the time that Chriſt was baptized, to the time that he ſuffered: which though they be not all of them mentioned by one

                     <p>Between the firſt and ſecond of theſe Paſſovers, it was that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was caſt into priſon: and then was the full beginning of Chriſts Miniſtery. For now was the courſe of his forerunner accompliſhed, and therefore now muſt Chriſt be only looked upon as the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> here being the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the laſt week of the Seventy: from whence our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour preached three yeares and an halfe, before he ſuffered. For though there were ſome Teſtimonies and manifeſtations of Chriſt before, yet was not the time of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> fully come till now, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.14.15.

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is recorded by <hi>Maymonides,</hi> that no <hi>Paſcha</hi> might be kept but of thoſe Lambs which were killed by the Prieſts in the Temple.</p>
                     <p>But that was not ſo: as appeareth by the Teſtimony of <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> who expreſly writeth,
<note place="margin">Philo in vita Moſis, et in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro de Decalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</note> that in the <hi>Paſchal</hi> feſtivity all the <hi>Jewes</hi> exerciſed the Prieſts office, in regard that every one at his own home might Sacrifice the Lamb. Thus he; a man who had ſeen the obſervation of many a Paſſover, which <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> never did. For <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> lived in Chriſts time; but <hi>Maymonides</hi> was not till a long time after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> therefore and <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> followed <hi>Rambam</hi> or <hi>Maymonides</hi> too confidently in this particular: as alſo in that of the <hi>Chagigah,</hi> which they ſay was a voluntary ſacrifice, and not of command: for it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, we as may ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.2. There might indeed no <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>in, but at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and tha's the reaſon
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115738:125"/>why the <hi>Jewes</hi> now obſerve no Paſſover: and in the Temple were ſome Lambs likewiſe ſlaine by the Prieſts, but it was for them who came out of the Country to keepe the Feaſt. For the Inhabitants of the City were at their owne choice, and might take a Lamb and kill it at their owne houſes; how elſe could they exerciſe the Prieſts office in this Sacrifice of the Lamb, which <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> ſaith they did?</p>
                     <p>They who ſay our Saviour (in the year when he ſuffered) kept not the Paſſover on the ſame day with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ground their tenet upon theſe texts. Firſt upon that of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chapt. 19. verſ. 14. where the day on the which Chriſt was put to death is expreſly called The preparation of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And in the Chapter before, at the 28 verſe, The <hi>Iowes</hi> themſelves went not into the Judgement Hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled: but that they might eat the Paſſover. And in <hi>Matthew</hi> 27.62. the day after Chriſts death and buriall, is called the day that was next after the preparation. And in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.31. The <hi>Iews</hi> becauſe it was the Preparation, that the bodies ſhould not remaine on the Croſſe on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an high day) beſought <hi>Pilate</hi> that their legges might be broken, and that they might be taken away. Which texts ſeeme to prove that for which they are cited.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all which, ſome there be who upon good grounds maintaine the contrary, and are very confident that the <hi>Iewes</hi> and Chriſt kept one and the ſame day: And for proofe thereof they alleadge theſe places. Firſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.6.2. You know (ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples) that after two dayes is the Paſſover: and the Sonne of Man is given up to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.
<note place="margin">The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts do here call the 14 of <hi>Niſan</hi> the day of unleavened bread, becauſe on that day as ſoon as dinner was over the people caſt all leaven out of their houſes.</note> Which ſpeech importeth a generall agreement for the Paſſover. And ſo much ſaith Saint <hi>Mark</hi> chap. 14. verſ. 12. On the firſt day of the * unleavened Bread, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſacrificed the Paſſover, two of his Diſciples ſaid: where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayeſt eat the Paſſover. And in <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.7.8. Then came the day of unleavened Bread, when the Paſſover muſt be killed. And he ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſaying, Go and prepare us the Paſſover that we may eat. In which texts by the words [when they ſacrificed the Paſſover, and when the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115738:125"/>Paſſover muſt be killed] is alſo ſhewed that thre was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall agreement for the time of the Paſſover,
<note place="margin">which muſt be done before the Lamb was ſlaine: at the eating where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they firſt of all began to eat unleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread, &amp; ſo continued for the ſpace of 7 dayes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.8.15. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.4.</note> and that our Lord and all the <hi>Iewes</hi> kept one and the ſame day for the killing and eating the Lamb.</p>
                     <p>And therefore to that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.28. they anſwer, that there is meant not the eating of the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb, but the Oxe, or the fleſh of the <hi>Chagigah</hi> Paſſover, which was added to the former, and commanded in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.2. where it is written thou ſhalt ſacrifice a <hi>Paſcha</hi> unto the Lord, of the Flocke, and of the Herd. The practice whereof was notably ſeen in that ſolemne Paſſover which <hi>Joſiah</hi> kept, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.7. The eating of this was for two dayes and one night, as ſaith <hi>Maymoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> Or elſe in the text objected is to be underſtood the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Loafes of Sweet-bread, which was to be obſerved for an whole weeke together. For as one obſerveth upon <hi>Luke</hi> 22.7. the word <hi>Paſcha,</hi> uſed for the Paſſover, is taken many wayes: As firſt, for the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.12. Secondly, for the whole weeke of Sweet-bread, or of the <hi>Paſchal</hi> ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which laſted ſeven dayes, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.3.4. Thirdly for the <hi>Paſchal</hi> ſolemnity of the ſixth day. Fourthly, for the houre of immolation &amp; eating of the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.1. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for whatſoever meate or bread belonging to the Feaſt, the <hi>Iewes</hi> eat during the ſolemnity thereof, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.28. where the ſtory telleth us, They would not goe into the Judgement Hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled; but that they might eat the Paſſover: that is ſaith he <hi>Azimos Panes,</hi> The unleavened Bread belonging to the Paſſover. Sixthly, for that which was figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Paſſover, <hi>to wit,</hi> Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. And Sevnthly, for the Feſtivity of the <hi>Paſchal</hi> cheer, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.7.18. If therefore the word <hi>Paſcha</hi> might be taken theſe many wayes, there is no neceſſity to tye us abſolutely to conclude, that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.28. the <hi>Iewes</hi> meant what they ſaid of eating the Paſſover, to be underſtood of the Lamb rather then of any other thing eaten by them at that Feaſt.</p>
                     <p>But how will that place in <hi>Iob.</hi> 19.14. be anſwered; where the day of Chriſts death is called the Preparation of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? It is called there the Preparation of the Paſſover; not
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115738:126"/>in regard of the Paſſover, but in regard of the Sabbath in the Paſſover, as Maſter <hi>Perkns</hi> obſerveth. In <hi>Marke</hi> therefore, chap. 15. verſe 42. it is called the Preparation (not of the Paſſover, but the preparation) which went before the Sabbath. And in <hi>Luke</hi> 23.54. It was the Preparation (ſaith the Evangeliſt) and the Sabbath drew on. Which Sabbath was an high day, becauſe of the <hi>Chagigah</hi> Paſſover which was then to be eaten, ae well as on the day before. Or elſe thus: The forenoon of the day of Chriſts death was the Preparation to the eating of the Paſſeover Bullocke; and in the afternoone was the Preparation of the Sabbath. And thus is this Text anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>From it alſo appeareth, that the tranſlation of dayes which <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſpeaketh of, was not in uſe ſo ſoone as theſe times. For though the late <hi>Iewes</hi> tell us that the conſtitutions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging, were ſet forth by <hi>Eleazar</hi> in the beginning of the ſecond Temple, and that they have a book treating of the motion of the Sun &amp; the Moon, ſaid to be written by <hi>Rabbi Gamaliel,</hi> in which this tranſlation of dayes is confirmed: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſay they tell us theſe things, yet will the whole be found inventions of a later age.</p>
                     <p>For when the Authors of the <hi>Miſchna</hi> and <hi>Thalmud</hi> lived, the ſixteenth day of <hi>Niſan</hi> might be on the Sabbath day, as is written <hi>Cod. Peſachim,</hi> cap. 7. And if the ſixteenth were and might be Sabbath day, then both was and might the fifteenth be <hi>feria ſexta:</hi> as it was in this year of our Saviours Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Learned <hi>Langius</hi> hath gallantly declared this: howbeit he agreeth with thoſe who ſay Chriſt and the <hi>Iewes</hi> kept not one and the ſame day. And the reaſon of their difference he taketh to be in regard of two chief Sects among the <hi>Iewes, viz.</hi> the <hi>Karraeans,</hi> and the <hi>Thalmudiſts:</hi> who though they both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their Moneths according to the <hi>Phaſis</hi> or Viſion of the Moon, yet in regard of the manner of their obſervation they did ſometimes differ a day each from other; inſomuch that that which to the <hi>Karraeans</hi> was the ſecond day of the Moneth, The <hi>Thalmudiſts</hi> accounted but the firſt. And ſo it was (ſaith he) in that year when Chriſt ſuffered. Now Chriſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115738:126"/>following the <hi>Karraeans,</hi> did therfore eat the Paſſover one day ſooner then the reſt of the <hi>Iewes</hi> who followed the <hi>Thalmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts.</hi> But I doubt much of the truth of this opinion, not only becauſe all the <hi>Iewes</hi> kept one and the ſame day, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed; but alſo becauſe it maketh Chriſts Paſſion (as he accounts the difference, now and in this yeare) to be on the Thurſday, and fifth day of the weeke, which is contrary to the Scriptures, and to all the Creeds of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                     <p>I confeſſe him indeed to be a man of full deepe learning, much reading, and great knowledge in the Tongues: but in this I doe beleeve he will have but few to follow him; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering what the Apoſtle ſaith, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4. namely, That Chriſt roſe againe the third day, according to the Scriptures: wheras by his opinion, he muſt not ariſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the fourth day. If then the third be according to the Scriptures, the fourth is not, but is to be refuſed of all them who will be guided by the Scriptures.</p>

                     <p>WHen the reignes of <hi>Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> had well neare meaſured the length of a year, then was <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> advanced to the Empire: in the ſecond yeare of whoſe reigne his ſonne <hi>Titus</hi> deſtroyed the City and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> this deſtruction falling out to be in the yeare of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4783. and ſeventyeth yeare of Chriſt according to the Vulgar and common account. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents (as <hi>Egeſippus, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Euſebius, Hierom,</hi> and others) ſay that it was 40 yeares after Chriſt's Paſſion: and the reaſon of that I take to be, becauſe many of the Fathers accounted Chriſt's Baptiſme to be in the twelfth yeare of <hi>Tiherius,</hi> and his Paſſion in the fifteenth; which was certaine
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115738:127"/>an abſolute error, as I have already plainly ſhewed. I take it therefore for granted that this was the yeare when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed, and have already proved it ſo in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter.</p>
                     <p>It was without doubt a diſmall overthrow; and ſundry were the Signs and tokens that went before it: of which we read at large in <hi>Joſephus De bello Judaico, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. as alſo in <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Ecleſiaſticall Hiſtory, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>There was a terrible blazing Starre or Comet faſhioned like a Sword, which for a years ſpace, in threatning manner hung over the City.</p>
                     <p>The Moon ſuffered an Eclipſe for twelve nights together. Before the Warre, in the Feaſt of Sweet-bread, upon the eighth day of <hi>April</hi> in the night a clear light as bright as day was ſeene in the Temple, abiding the full ſpace of halfe an houre. And upon the ſame Feaſt, day a Calfe being prepared for the Sacrifice, brought forth a Lamb in the middle of the Temple. The Eaſt Gate of the inward Temple, being a Gate of Braſſe, faſt locked and barred, opened by its own accord; this was about the middle of the night and much labour there was to ſhut it up againe. Some few dayes after, upon the 21. day of <hi>May</hi> a little before Sun-ſetting, in the Skies were ſeen Armies of men fighting, and Horſes and Chariots running too and fro. And on the day of Pentecoſt the Prieſts entring into the Temple according to their cuſtome, heard a terrible voice ſounding out theſe words <hi>Let us go hence.</hi> But that (ſaith <hi>Joſephus</hi>) which was more terrible then all theſe, was the crie of one Joſus the ſonne of <hi>Anani;</hi> He was a man of the common ſort of people, and brought up in the Country, who in the dayes of <hi>Albinus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour of <hi>Judea</hi> &amp; <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> at the Feaſt of Tabernacles (four yeares before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Warres) ſuddainly as he was in the Temple began to cry after this manner; <hi>A voice from the Eaſt, a voice from the Weſt, a voice from the four Winds, a voice againſt.</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>and the Temple, a voice againſt the Bridegroomes and Brides, and a voice againſt the whole multitude of the City.</hi> In which manner he continued crying day and night, up and downe the ſtreets,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115738:127"/>without any hoarſneſſe or wearineſſe, for the ſpace of ſeven yeares and five Moneths, but chiefly on the Feaſt dayes; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther curſing them that hurt him, nor thanking them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved him: and being brought before the Deputy by the Magiſtrates and Nobles of the City, they whip this fleſh to the very bones, for which he neither wept nor craved mercy, but at every ſtroke cried <hi>Woe, woe to Jeruſalem:</hi> and at laſt climbing up upon the Wals, when the City was beſieged, he adds theſe words, <hi>And woe alſo to mine one ſelfe;</hi> upon the uttering whereof he was preſently ſlain by the Enemies with a ſtone caſt at him out of an Engine.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and the like tokens were ſignes that God gives war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before he puniſheth; whereupon ſaith <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> in his 46 <hi>Homilie</hi> upon Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> God doth not puniſh a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or a City ſo ſoone as they offend, but ſuſpends his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for many generations; and one while commandeth, another while threatneth, and ſometimes addeth a ſmall correction; that by how much the longer he hath expected, by ſo much his judgements may be the more juſt, and their puniſhment the more deſerved. Oh <hi>Jeruſalem,
<note place="margin">Mat. 23.37.</note> Jeruſalem</hi> (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith our Saviour) thou that killeſt the Prophets and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her chickins under her Wings, but ye would not: And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it came to paſſe that that City which ſeemed as a thing impregnable, was taken by the <hi>Romans</hi> on the ſeventh day of <hi>Elul</hi> (which in this yeare was on the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the weeke) and on the day following it was burnt and deſtroyed and made ſo ruinous that quickly after it was wholly demoliſhed and caſt downe, there not being one ſtone left upon another; therein fulfilling the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Chriſt, in <hi>Luke</hi> 19.43, 44.</p>
                     <p>And hereupon it is that <hi>Dion Nicaeus,</hi> in the life of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> ſaith; <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was taken on the Sabbath day: <hi>Die Saturni Judaeis ſacro.</hi>

                     <p>All that I have to ſay more, before I come to the Kalender, is a note upon a paſſage or two in <hi>Joſephus:</hi> the one hath place in this Table: the other concerns the Kalender. That which belongs to this Table, is what <hi>Joſephus</hi> mentions in the ſixteenth booke and ninth Chapter of his <hi>Antiquities,</hi> concerning the great ſolemnity which was at the dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> &amp; that it was in the tenth year after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the building thereof, <hi>to wit,</hi> in the eight and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth year of <hi>Herod,</hi> and in the 192. <hi>Olympiad:</hi> which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally underſtood of the firſt year therof, in regard of the many ſports and games uſed when this City was dedicated. Now upon this ground it is that <hi>Lanſbergius</hi> beginneth not the firſt year of <hi>Herod</hi> untill the next yeare after the Confulſhips of <hi>Domitius Calvinus,</hi> and <hi>Aſinius Pollio:</hi> and ſetteth not the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by him and <hi>Soſius</hi> untill the yeare of the City 717, which was the tenth <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and yeare when <hi>L-Gellius</hi> and <hi>M-Cocceius</hi> were Conſuls.</p>
                     <p>But ſurely that wherein <hi>Ioſephus</hi> himſelfe was miſtaken, can be no ſure ground for others to build upon: it will appeare ſo out of his fifteenth Booke and thirteenth Chapter. For there we finde that the Dedication of <hi>Ceſaraea</hi> was in the twelfth year after it began to be built; which muſt therefore make it to be in the thirtieth yeare of <hi>Herod:</hi> and this, not the thirtieth ſince he firſt began to reigne, but the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth ſince the death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> at the taking of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And as for the <hi>Olympiad,</hi> that will alſo appeare to be 193, in the firſt year whereof was the thirtieth year of <hi>Herod</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. And why 193, is in regard <hi>Caeſarea</hi> was not dedicated after it was built untill <hi>Druſus</hi> was dead, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> alſo in the place above cited hath declared. Now <hi>Druſus</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, and alive in the fourth year of the 192, <hi>Olympiad,</hi> but dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame year, as <hi>Velleius</hi> ſheweth, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 97. All which conſidered, will make it very plain and manifeſt that I have rightly explained <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in this particular; as alſo that the building of the Temple by King <hi>Herod,</hi> was not begun untill his twentieth year: for there muſt be as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115738:130"/>between the true and ordinarie account, as is between ten and twelve.</p>
                     <p>That which concernes the <hi>Kalender,</hi> is nothing elſe but the joyning of ſeverall Moneths together; which without wrong to <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> cannot be underſtood of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> Moneths, but of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Moneths: for their dayes accord in the Kalender, but not the other.</p>
                     <p>The Kalender is for the yeare of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4783. when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as I have already ſaid) was deſtroyed by the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Cycle of the Sun then was 23, the Dominicall letter G. and the Cycle of the Moon 14. By which is gathered that the firſt day of the firſt Moneth, namely <hi>Niſan,</hi> was on or near the laſt day of <hi>March:</hi> for the meane conjunction of the <hi>Luminaries</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was on the thirtieth day of <hi>March,</hi> 24 minutes paſt two in the afternoon; And therefore the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth being according to the Viſion of the Moon, could not begin untill the next day at the ſooneſt. And ſo alſo for the fifth Moneth <hi>Ab,</hi> the Conjunction was on the ſix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day of <hi>July,</hi> about 24 minutes paſt five in the afternoon: the firſt day of <hi>Ab</hi> was not therefore till the twenty ſeventh day: and conſequently the ninth of <hi>Ab</hi> not till the fourth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which day was Sabbath day. But the ninth of <hi>Ab,</hi> faith <hi>Scaliger,</hi> was <hi>feria prima:</hi> agreeing therein to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Rabbi Ioſe,</hi> who writeth that the Temple was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by <hi>Titus</hi> on the ninth of <hi>Ab</hi> and evening of the Sabbath day;
<note place="margin">See Maſter <hi>Lively</hi> in his Perſian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, p. 151.</note> which I underſtand of the evening ending the Sabbath. Which alſo the <hi>Seder Olam Rabba</hi> ſheweth, ſaying; when the firſt Temple was deſtroyed, that day was the next after the Sabbath, and the next after the weeks end, and the Courſe of <hi>Iehoiarib,</hi> and the ninth of <hi>Ab:</hi> and in like manner was it at the deſtruction of the ſecond Temple. We have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy found it to be ſo at the deſtruction of the firſt Temple: and by theſe teſtimonies it ſhould be ſo at the deſtruction of the ſecond Temple. And indeed the late time of the day when the Luminaries were in Conjuction, do rather caſt the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fifth Moneth into the day that the <hi>Seder Olam</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115738:130"/>then into the day before <hi>Scaliger</hi> therefore makes here a two fold calculation: and approves beſt of that which makes the ninth of <hi>Ab</hi> to be on the firſt day of the weeke. I ſhall therefore begin the firſt day of the firſt Moneth on the firſt of <hi>April:</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Ab</hi> on the 28th day of <hi>Iuly;</hi> as in the Kalender following may be ſeen. And why I give it the title of a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kalender, is becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Moneths as they did their owne: chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as other people did, who had been

                        <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F <hi>Heber</hi> it is ſaid in <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.25. And unto <hi>Heber</hi> were borne two Sonnes, the name of the one was <hi>Peleg,</hi> for in his dayes was the Earth divided; and his brothers name was <hi>Jocktan.</hi> Now this <hi>Jocktan</hi> had thirteene ſonnes, men growne at the confuſion of Tongues, as the verſes following make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent: and therefore that diviſion of the Earth which was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115738:137"/>made at the birth of <hi>Peleg</hi> (if the text be ſo to be underſtood, as that there muſt be a diviſion then) could not be the ſame with that which was at the confuſion of Tongues; for <hi>Heber</hi> was but 34. yeares old when <hi>Peleg</hi> was borne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.16. and <hi>Jocktan</hi> (though he were borne before) could not be old e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have any of his Sons either born, or (if borne) of age ſufficient at their Vncles birth, to be Conductors of <hi>Colonies</hi> from <hi>Babel</hi> to other Countries. The confuſion of Tongues was therefore long after the birth of <hi>Peleg,</hi> and yet at the time of his birth there might be a diviſion made of the Earth by <hi>Noah,</hi> who (when he ſaw his Sonnes and their Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to increaſe) might take in hand to divide the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, appointing to the head of each Family his place and portion: but they loath to breake company, and not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſeparate themſelves each from other, departed away together from the Eaſt, where the Arke reſted, to the Land of <hi>Shinar</hi> where they found a Plain that pleaſed them, and for a time they dwelled there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.1, 2. This time of their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there before they began to build the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> might end about fourteen yeeres after the birth of <hi>Peleg:</hi> for ſo long time I find between his birth and the beginning of of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> date, which at the time when <hi>Alexander</hi> the great took <hi>Babylon</hi> (as was obſerved by <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, then preſent) was running on in the yeare thereof 1903. which was alſo the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4484. out of which if we take 1902. compleat, the beginning of the ſaid date will be in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2482. There therefore upon this ground I juſtly fix it, and doe there alſo (for the reaſons aforeſaid concerning <hi>Jocktan</hi> and his Sonnes) place the beginning of that Tower whoſe top they intended ſhould reach unto Heaven. Perhaps they might begin the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before, but not the Tower. This Tower as <hi>Michael Glycas</hi> ſaith was forty yeares in building, which will therefore make the confuſion of Tongues to be 54. yeares after the birth of <hi>Peleg,</hi> by which time the very yongeſt of <hi>Jocktans</hi> Sons might be of age ſufficient to conduct a <hi>Colonie</hi> from thence according to the diviſion of his Tongue.</p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:115738:137"/>
                     <p>This I find to be 155. yeares after the Flood was ended, in the yeare of the World 1813. and in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2522. And now had <hi>Nimrod</hi> reigned forty yeares from the beginning of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Date; or at leaſt had been a mighty man among them that built this City and Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> for ſo long a time.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture ſaith, <hi>he began to be a mighty one in the Earth, Gen.</hi> 10.8. thereby declaring that he was the firſt who had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers under him. Which if he began to have when the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons firſt began to build the City, and Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> as we find in <hi>Joſephus;</hi> then had he more under his command at that time then when Languages were confounded: And for that cauſe perhaps it was that afterwards he ranged further (like a mighty Hunter) to inlarge his Dominions. For after he had builded and gotten to himſelfe <hi>Babel, Erech, Accad</hi> and <hi>Chalne</hi> in the Land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> he went out of that Land (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) into <hi>Aſſiria,</hi> and builded <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and the City <hi>Reh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>both,</hi> and <hi>Chalah,</hi> and <hi>Reſen</hi> between <hi>Niniveh</hi> and <hi>Chalah, Gen.</hi> 10.11.12. Some I know read that text otherwiſe; as thus, <hi>Out of that Land went</hi> Aſhur <hi>and builded</hi> Niniveh. Concluding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that <hi>Aſhur</hi> of <hi>Sems</hi> race, being wearied with <hi>Nimrods</hi> cruelty, went out of <hi>Shinar</hi> into another Country which he called after his owne name, and there built <hi>Niniveh</hi> with the three other Cities aforeſaid. But of this there is little proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: more like it is that <hi>Nimrod</hi> (as I ſaid before) having gotten <hi>Babel, Erech, Accad</hi> and <hi>Chalne</hi> in the Land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> was not therewithall content, but coveting more and larger ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, advanced farther, even into the Land of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and there he built <hi>Niniveh</hi> with three Cities more. For this we are to note that the Scripture names not <hi>Aſhur</hi> who came of <hi>Sem</hi> to be the mighty Hunter, but <hi>Nimrod</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Cuſh,</hi> and the Grandchild of <hi>Cham.</hi> The margent therefore of our laſt Tranſlation doth not without cauſe point us to that reading which at the firſt I mentioned; agreeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to learned <hi>Junius, Willet,</hi> and a great many more of good note, whom upon neceſſity I am bound now to follow, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I will acquit <hi>Nimrod</hi> of that brand which the Scripture
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115738:138"/>layes upon him, and by following a wrong tranſlation lay it without other warrant upon another. This I may not do: and therefore I look upon <hi>Nimrod</hi> ſtill as the great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hunter, who was the firſt that hunted out of one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into another to inlarge his dominions.</p>
                     <p>This he began to doe eight yeares after the confuſion of Tongues, <hi>viz.</hi> in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2530. when the yeare of the World was 1821. And why I place <hi>Nimrods</hi> going into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> his building of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and laying the foundation of a Kingdome there in this yeare, is becauſe it muſt be about one thouſand yeares before the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> hath told us, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. Now <hi>Troy</hi> (as we know) was deſtroyed in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3530. at which time (as he alſo ſaith) <hi>Tautanes</hi> reigned in <hi>Aſſyria: Tautanes</hi> and not <hi>Semiramis;</hi> for ſhe was rather in the Patriarch <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, when (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith) the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> had the Empire of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Howbeit ſome have accounted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: the ground of which miſtake I do beleeve aroſe firſt from hence and came to be embraced, both becauſe there were more <hi>Zoroaſters</hi> then one, and alſo becauſe there was another <hi>Semiramis</hi> later then ſhe that reigned next after <hi>Ninus</hi> the grandchild of <hi>Nimrod.</hi> One of the <hi>Zoroaſters</hi> was but ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares before <hi>Xerxes</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> went with his huge Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into <hi>Greece,</hi> as <hi>Xanthus Lydius</hi> mentioned by <hi>Diogenes Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> hath told us: another long before and was that King of the <hi>Bactrians</hi> with whom King <hi>Ninus</hi> waged warre, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Juſtin</hi> out of <hi>Trogus</hi> teſtifie. And as for <hi>Semiramis,</hi> the firſt was the daughter of <hi>Derceto,</hi> begotten on her by an unknown man: the other was the daughter of the ſecond <hi>Belochus</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> many years after <hi>Ninus.</hi> And therefore whereas <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrius</hi> alledgeth out of <hi>Sanchoniato</hi> that <hi>Semiramis</hi> was not long after the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it muſt be underſtood of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and not of the firſt <hi>Semiramis:</hi> for the latter indeed began to flouriſh with her Father, not above 15. years after the death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as by warrantable computation appeareth; but the former was a long time before.</p>
                     <p>But to returne again to <hi>Nimrod;</hi> he (as I ſaid) began to lay
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115738:138"/>the foundation of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Kingdome in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2530. from whence it continued, without any great alteration, till the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3893. in which year <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> came to his end through the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy that <hi>Arbaces</hi> and <hi>Beleſis</hi> made againſt him. For when they ſaw how he retired himſelfe from his Nobles, and betooke him to ſpin and dally with his Curtizans, they then riſe up in Arms againſt him, and doe at laſt drive him to ſacrifice himſelfe with his Wealth nd Wenches, to <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulcan</hi> in a great pile of Wood ſet on fire, that in it he might dye with all his Delights about him: in which onely thing (ſaith <hi>Juſtin</hi>) he ſhewed himſelfe a man.</p>
                     <p>This time of his death was 1238. yeares after <hi>Ninus</hi> began, as in <hi>Euſebius</hi> may be ſeene by gathering into one ſumme the particular years of the Kings that reigned here. And as it was 1238 years after <hi>Ninus</hi> (before whom <hi>Belus,</hi> next after <hi>Nimrod</hi> reigned ſixty five years:) So was it 1363. yeares from the time that <hi>Nimrod</hi> came out of <hi>Shinar</hi> and founded firſt this Kingdome here. <hi>Herodotus</hi> I know fals far ſhort of theſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but is followed by none of the Ancients, neither <hi>Cteſias, Trogus Pompeius, Diodorus Siculus, Velleius Paterculus, Joſephus, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> nor <hi>Auguſtine. Cteſias</hi> I confeſſe reckons 1360. from <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to the death of <hi>Sardanapalus:</hi> but it had been better and in a manner right, if he had reckoned from the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid when <hi>Nimrod</hi> went into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> built <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and laid the foundation of this Kingdome there: for in reckoning ſo, I can find but three years difference between him and my ſelfe. <hi>Trogus</hi> (or <hi>Juſtin</hi> out of him) reckons no more then 1300. leaving out perhaps the ſixty three odde years, and ſpeakes onely of the round or even number: but begins (as <hi>Cteſias</hi> before him) from <hi>Ninus</hi> inſtead of beginning from the time when <hi>Niniveh</hi> was firſt founded. Or rather, he accounts 1300. from <hi>Ninus</hi> to the time aforeſaid; inſtead of accounting them from <hi>Belus</hi> the Father of <hi>Ninus:</hi> for from <hi>Belus</hi> to the end of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> were but three yeares more; as will afterwards better appeare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diodore,</hi> in the end of his ſecond book, ſaith that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115738:139"/>continued more then 1400. yeares; which is alſo true, if we account from the time that <hi>Nimrod</hi> (who alſo founded this Kingdome) began to reigne at <hi>Babylon:</hi> for from thence hither were 1411. yeares. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>elleius</hi> helpeth nothing for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but much for the ending: for by him we gather that this Kingdome ended not many more then ſixty five years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the building of <hi>Rome;</hi> which upon a preciſe account was juſt ſixty nine befor <hi>Romulus</hi> laid the foundation thereof. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebeus</hi> without queſtion had ſeene all theſe, but ſought not thus narrowly into the ground of their difference: howbeit he might and did perceive they all aimed at this, to make <hi>Ninus</hi> the Eſtabliſher of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Kingdome: At him therefore he begins his Chronology, and finds (according to the teſtimony aforeſaid) that in the Temple of the <hi>Trojan</hi> warre and when <hi>Troy</hi> was taken, <hi>Tautanes</hi> reigned in <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> This <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Diod. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. Moreover <hi>Euſebius</hi> (by ſome Teſtimony ſure that he had ſeen) dates the time of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> by the reignes of <hi>Ariphron</hi> and <hi>Teſpieus, Archons</hi> of <hi>Athens:</hi> namely that in one of them he began to reigne; and in the other he loſt his life when <hi>Arbaces</hi> and <hi>Beleſis</hi> roſe up againſt him.</p>
                     <p>I reckon therefore that <hi>Belus</hi> (who was the next King after <hi>Nimrod</hi>) began his reigne in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2590. and reigned (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſay) ſixty five yeares. He was a man of a more contenting diſpoſition then his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and imployed himſelfe moſt in drayning the Fennes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Babylon,</hi> and carrying of the water from the low grounds to make the Country the more uſeful: which pleaſing govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his was ſo gratefull to his Subjects, as that they even deified him, and made him the Sire of many petty gods; ſuch as <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115738:139"/>he had a Temple built for him in <hi>Babylon,</hi> which in <hi>Plinie</hi> his time was ſtanding ſtill: who alſo ſaith of him, that he was the Inventor of <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> and that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> dedicated a Jewel to him, which they call <hi>Belus</hi> his eye. He might perhaps adde ſomething conſiderable to <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> though the Art it ſelf was found out long before. Moreover the <hi>Caldeans</hi> prefixed <hi>Bel,</hi> or <hi>Bal,</hi> as an Enſigne of honour to their names; as <hi>Baladan, Balthaſar.</hi> The <hi>Carthagineans,</hi> they added it to theirs; as may beſeen in the names of <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> and <hi>Hanibal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But how long did <hi>Nimrod</hi> reign before this <hi>Belus</hi> began?</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, that he reigned eight and forty yeares in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſixty yeares in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which together do make 108. from the beginning of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> as already in what I have written by way of computation may be ſeen. Nor is this time of reigne too long; it ſeemes rather too ſhort, if we conſider how long men lived in thoſe dayes.</p>

                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115738:140"/>was counted the Foundreſſe of the City which ſhe onely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: ſo alſo <hi>Ninus</hi> of <hi>Niniveh.</hi> For ſo did <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> vaunt himſelfe to be the Founder of <hi>Babylon</hi> alſo, becauſe he built up again ſome part of the Wall, over born by the fury of the River: which worke of his ſtood till <hi>Alexanders</hi> time, whereupon he vaunted thus, Is not this great <hi>Babel</hi> that I have built, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. Thus then theſe workes of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Niniveh,</hi> begun by <hi>Nimrod</hi> in <hi>Chaldea</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria, Ninus</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis</hi> made perfect. <hi>Ninus</hi> finiſhed <hi>Niniveh, Semiramis Babylon</hi> wherein ſhe thought to exceed her Husband by farre.

                     <p>I ſhall not need therefore to anſwer further to objections made out of other Authors concerning the building of theſe Cities, as if they were to owne no other Builders but <hi>Ninus</hi> and <hi>Semiramis:</hi> for it is one thing to begin, another thing to adde and bring to perfection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nimrod</hi> did the firſt, they the latter; the fame whereof, in after ages, ſwallowed up the memory of the firſt Founder, and made thoſe Authors which knew not the holy Scripture ſpeak as they did without diſtinction.</p>
                     <p>Leaving this therefore I ſhall come more neerly to <hi>Ninus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ninus.</note> who when he inlarged <hi>Niniveh</hi> imparted to it his own name: He began to reign in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2655. and (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith) reigned fity two yeares. He cauſed the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> of his Father <hi>Belus</hi> to be ſet up and worſhipped, probably in that Temple which was built for him in <hi>Babylon:</hi> which I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his (as ſome ſay) continued untill <hi>Daniels,</hi> when it was deſtroyed by <hi>Darius Medus</hi> or <hi>Cyrus,</hi> upon the diſcovery of the Impoſture of <hi>Bels</hi> Prieſts, ſhewen in that <hi>Apocriphall</hi> fragment of <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon. Nimrod</hi> being the firſt, he muſt needs be the third King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> in whoſe time the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> was very large: for there was then no Kingdom ſo famous nor ſo ſpatious as the <hi>Aſſyrian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> which was afterward increaſed by <hi>Semiramis</hi> after his death, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> writeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>De Civit. Dei.

In which I think <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115738:140"/>was not altogether right, for his whole time of reign was but fifty two yeares; in the beginning whereof he was buſied in the building of that Temple which he built in honour of his dead Father <hi>Belus,</hi> and at the firſt had but a ſmall part of <hi>Aſia</hi> under his command, as <hi>Dionyſius Halcarnaſſenſis</hi> ſaith in the firſt booke of his <hi>Roman Antiquities,</hi> but afterward, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſociety with <hi>Ariaeus</hi> King of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> he did in ſeventeen yeares bring all <hi>Aſia</hi> under his ſubjection, excepting the <hi>Indians</hi> and the <hi>Bactrians;</hi> and at the laſt the <hi>Bactrians</hi> were ſubdued by him, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Juſtin</hi> teſtifie. At which time <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> was King of that Country, and ſlaine by him: of whom Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> writeth, that he laughed at the time of his birth; which prodigious mirth, in the opinion of the ſame Father, booded him no good: for he was (ſaith he) as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the firſt Inventor of Magicke. By which if he meaneth Naturall Magicke, being the knowledge of things in reſpect of their cauſes, there was no cauſe why he ſhould be blamed: For (as <hi>Plinie</hi> alſo writeth) he not onely laughed when he was born, but had alſo ſuch a brain as was perceived to beat at the time of his birth; which ſignified ſome great Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to be in him, as appeared afterward when he was growne up: I meane if this were that <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> whom <hi>Ninus</hi> ſlew.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Euſebius</hi> would that <hi>Abram</hi> ſhould be borne in the three and fortieth year of this King <hi>Ninus</hi> his reign: but note that this is not from any given or recorded Teſtimony that he thus placeth <hi>Abrams</hi> birth, but from that manner of reckoning which he bringeth back from the fifteenth yeare of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> as may be ſeen in his tenth booke, and third Chapter <hi>De Praep. Evang.</hi> And in that regard, though he be followed by Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> and ſome other of the Ancients, yet a righter computation may be made by ſuch as ſhall more exactly caſt the times according to Scripture, and then apply the accounts thereunto following therein the <hi>Hebrew</hi> verity, and not the numbers which the <hi>Septuagint</hi> produceth.</p>
                     <p>Next after <hi>Ninus,</hi> was his Wife <hi>Semiramis:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Semiramis</note> ſhe ſucceeded her Husband, and began to reigne in the yeare of the <hi>Julian
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115738:141"/>Period</hi> 2707. twelve years compleat before the birth of <hi>Abram;</hi> for his birth falleth into the thirteenth yeare of her reigne. She was the daughter of a Nimph whoſe name was <hi>Dercero,</hi> and was begotten on her by an unknowne man; for which cauſe ſhe drowned her ſelfe in the Lake <hi>Aſcalon</hi> as ſoon as ſhe was delivered, and left this her daughter <hi>Semiramis</hi> among the Rocks, where the wilde Beaſts fed her with their Milke, till <hi>Symnas</hi> the Kings Sheapheard found her, who tooke her away and brought her up. And being very beautifull, ſhe was afterwards married to one <hi>Memnon</hi> a Noble man; by the meanes whereof ſhe became acquainted with King <hi>Ninus</hi> when he be ſieged the City <hi>Bactras,</hi> teaching him both how to take the City, and ſubdue the Country. He thereupon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring her wit, and being caught with her beauty, tooke her away from her Husband and married her: and ſhe afterward to poſſeſſe her ſelfe of the Throne, deſired of him to have all the power of royalty put into her hands, but for the ſpace of five dayes, which he granted; in which time ſhe cauſed him to beſlain, and then reigned after him forty two yeares. <hi>Diod. Euſeb.</hi> She inlarged the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> to admiration, which once being like to be ſurpriſed, upon hearing of it, ſhe reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her haire halfe hanging about her eares, not ſtaying to dreſſe it wholly, and therefore is ſo pictured.</p>
                     <p>Next after her was her Sonne <hi>Zameis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ninias.</note> otherwiſe called <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias;</hi> who began in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2749. and reigned 38. yeares. <hi>Euſeb.</hi> He was tenderly brought up by his Mother among her Ladies,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug de cipit dea lib.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> and was at the laſt ſlaine by him for her inceſtuous luſt towards him, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> noteth, ſaying; He did it becauſe ſhe bare an Inceſtuous luſt towards him; it being alſo uſuall with her to murder thoſe whom ſhe had to doe with. Howbeit her ſonne would not be thus dealt withand thereupon, both to prevent her murdering of him, and alſo though the hatred he bore to her unnaturall Act, he flew her, and reigned afte thirty eight yeares.</p>
                     <p>The next after him was <hi>Thuras,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Arius.</note> otherwiſe called <hi>Arius,</hi> or (according to <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Geneſts,</hi> chap. 14.) <hi>Amraphel.</hi> For by the courſe of time this muſt needs be he, who with the reſt of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115738:141"/>the confederate Princes came againſt <hi>Sodome,</hi> and tooke <hi>Lot</hi> priſoner, but was vanquiſhed by <hi>Abraham, Haner, Eſhcol,</hi> and <hi>Mamre, Gen.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Suidas</hi> ſaith of him, that he was a man of a fierce diſpoſition, who bidding battell to <hi>Caucaſus</hi> of the ſtocke of <hi>Japeth,</hi> ſlew him: but this may be fabulous. The ſame Author likewiſe ſaith, that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> deified him, and worſhipped his Image for a god. He began his reigne in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2787. and reigned (as ſaith <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> thirty years.</p>
                     <p>As for the reſt that follow from hence to <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi>

Onely let me note that <hi>Belochus</hi> the ſecond, who began his reigne in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3279. and reigned twenty five yeares, was (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> writeth) the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſecond <hi>Semiramis,</hi> who was famous in the time of his reigne. Alſo that <hi>Tautanes</hi> (who began his reigne in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3507. and reigned thirty two years) was in the time of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Warre, and (as already hath been ſaid) ſent Aid to <hi>Priamus:</hi> for ſo <hi>Diodorus</hi> writeth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſe I know no other, till we come to <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> that can have much more ſaid of them.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit I have ſomething ſtill to ſay, which would be mentioned here in this Chapter, wherein I treat of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Monarchy: and this it is. <hi>Calviſius</hi> (out of <hi>Julius Affrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) writeth, that in the eight and twentieth year of <hi>Belus</hi> the Father of <hi>Ninus</hi> aforeſaid, the Kingdome of <hi>Chalea</hi> was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to the Kingdome of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> Which I beleeve to be a meer miſtake: For this needed not, ſeeing in thoſe time, and a long while after, <hi>Chaldea</hi> end <hi>Aſſyria</hi> were both under one King. More like it is that in the eight and twentieth year of <hi>Belochus</hi> the firſt, the <hi>Caldeans</hi> revolted from the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and reigned apart in a <hi>Dynaſtie</hi> by themſelves, 224. yeares. At the end whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3176. the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahians</hi> overcame them and reigned in <hi>Chaldea</hi> untill 520.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115738:142"/>yeers before the overthrow of <hi>Sardanapalus:</hi> for when he was overthrowne by <hi>Arbaces,</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> had had the whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Aſia</hi> 520. yeares, as ſaith <hi>Herodotus, lib.</hi> 1.

                     <p>This Dynaſtie, according to the common account of it, is ſaid to continue 216. yeares: but indeed, when I have

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the Kingdome of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and of the Kings that reigned there.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THat Kingdome which by the courſe of time offers it ſelfe next to be conſidered, is the Kingdome of <hi>Egypt:</hi> in which to produce a right reckoning of the Kings that reigned there, is a thing of much perplexity. For <hi>Diodorus</hi> varies from <hi>Herodotus, Herodotus</hi> from <hi>Diodorus,</hi> and both of them from <hi>Africanus</hi> and <hi>Euſebius:</hi> which therefore made St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> omit the ſucceſſion of theſe Kings. For though he were a man of incomparable diligence, a great ſearcher into Antiquities, and one who had read the bookes of <hi>Marcus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arro,</hi> which now are loſt; yet he omitted the ſucceſſion of the Kings of <hi>Egypt:</hi> which ſurely (ſaith a learned Author) he had not done, if there had not been leſſe certainty in the accounts of their reignes then in the accounts of the <hi>Sycio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Argive, and <hi>Athenian</hi> Kings. One great occaſion of this obſcurity in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Story, was (as the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor alſo ſaith) the ambition of their fabling Prieſts; who to magnifie their Antiquities, filled the Records put into their truſt, with many falſities, and recounted unto ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115738:144"/>the names of many Kings that never reigned: Some whereof might be but Viceroyes (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was) and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned afterward as Kings; and others, but vain inventions of the ambitious Prieſts, who thought it their glory to boaſt much of great Antiquity.</p>
                     <p>But leaving them and their fabling, the accout which Maſter <hi>Lydyat</hi> bringeth (and another man more learned then he) from the Annals of <hi>Constantinns Manaſſes,</hi> carries with it a great probability of much truth; namely, that this Kingdome began 1663. yeares before <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> went and ſubdued it to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. The due conſideration of which caſteth the head of our reckoning into the yeere of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2525. which (as I account) was but three yeeres after the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Tongues. Now from this yeere of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> to the time that <hi>Saltis</hi> began to reigne in <hi>Egypt,</hi> were an hundred and ſix yeares; as by an account taken <hi>a poſteriori</hi> well appeareth.</p>
                     <p>The beginning therefore of <hi>Saltis</hi> was in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2631. whoſe time of reigne was (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith) nineteene yeares. <hi>Baeon</hi> ſucceeded, and reigned after him 44. yeares <hi>Apachnas</hi> after <hi>Baeon</hi> 36. yeares and ſeven Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths. <hi>Apochis</hi> after <hi>Apachnas</hi> ſixty yeares and one. <hi>Janias</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Apochis</hi> 50. yeares and one moneth. <hi>Aſſis</hi> after <hi>Janias</hi> 49. yeares and two Moneths: and with him I take it for certain, that that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called the 17th <hi>Dynaſtie</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; although how in this time there ſhould be ſo many <hi>Dynasties,</hi> I cannot ſee. For from the beginning of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the end of the reign of this King <hi>Aſſis,</hi> were but 366. yeares; and how they ſhould be divided into ſeventeene diſtinct and ſeverall <hi>Dynaſties,</hi> I am yet to learne.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit I ſhall be content to account ſeventeene of them to reach no further then to the time hitherto mentioned, that thereby I may the better goe on with them that follow. But firſt ſee a Catalogue or Liſt of all the Kings from <hi>Saltis,</hi> to the end of <hi>Aſſis,</hi> in their right times.</p>

                     <p>Next after theſe follow the Kings that reigned in the eighteenth <hi>Dynaſtie,</hi> as we likewiſe finde them in <hi>Joſephus;</hi> who, in his firſt booke againſt <hi>Apion,</hi> reckoneth on as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: beginning firſt with <hi>Themoſis</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſis,</hi> to whom he giveth 25. yeares and foure Moneths. <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron</hi> ſucceeded, and had twelve yeares. <hi>Amenophis</hi> 20. yeares and ſeven Moneths. <hi>Ameſſes</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Amenophis,</hi> 21. yeares and nine Moneths. <hi>Mephres</hi> twelve yeares and nine Moneths. <hi>Mephramuthoſis</hi> 25. years and ten Moneths. <hi>Thmoſis</hi> nine years and eight Moneths. <hi>Amenophis</hi> 30. yeares and ten Moneths. This is he who was ſirnamed <hi>Memnon,</hi> or the ſpeaking ſtone, becauſe his Image (as ſaith <hi>Euſebius, Strabo,</hi> and others) gave a ſound at the Sun-riſing, till the comming of Chriſt. The next after him was <hi>Orus,</hi> thirty ſix yeares and five Moneths. After <hi>Orus</hi> was <hi>Acenchres</hi> the daughter of <hi>Orus,</hi> 12. yeares and one moneth. Then <hi>Rathoris</hi> the brother of <hi>Acenchres,</hi> 9. yeares. His Sonne ſucceeded; his name <hi>Acencheres,</hi> and the time of his reign 12. yeares and five Moneths. Another <hi>Acencheres</hi> was after him, and reigned 12. yeares and three Moneths. <hi>Armais</hi> foure yeares and one Moneth. <hi>Armeſis</hi> one yeare, and four Moneths: or as he is otherwiſe written, <hi>Rameſſes</hi> by a tranſpoſition of letters. His ſucceſſour had the ſame name, and was <hi>Rameſſes Miamun,</hi> though commonly written <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſmiamun:</hi> the time of whoſe reigne was ſixty ſix yeeres and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115738:145"/>two Moneths. This was that new King which knew not <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> as being born after his death, and willing to forget the memory of his benefits, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.8. The hard bondage of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> began in his time: His Daughter was <hi>Thermutis,</hi> by whom <hi>Moſes</hi> was preſerved; for ſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> call her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amenophis</hi> ſucceeded next in the Kingdome of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and reigned after <hi>Amneſeſmiamun,</hi> nineteene yeares and ſix Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths: and not untill the end thereof were the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> delivered. For though his Predeceſſor (who reigned long) was dead and gone yet their bondage ſtill endured, as is noted by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.23. where the words be theſe; <hi>And it came to paſſe after a long time, that the King of</hi> Egypt <hi>died, and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſighing by reaſon of the bondage, cryed, &amp;c.</hi> that is, they cryed by reaſon of their hard bondage and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude which ſtill continued, notwithſtanding the long reign of the former King was ended. Now this King (as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid before) reigned nineteene yeares and ſix Moneths, and pears plainly to be that very <hi>Pharaoh</hi> which was drowned in the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> Nor doth <hi>Manetho</hi> but confeſſe as much, in that which <hi>Joſephus</hi> relateth out of him, in his firſt book againſt <hi>Apion.</hi> For though <hi>Manetho</hi> (like a lying Prieſt of <hi>Egypt</hi>) doth what he can, with fabulous reports, to colour over the matter for the credit of his Nation: yet all things well obſerved he hath delivered enough to ſhew that <hi>Amenophis</hi> here mentioned was that King that followed after <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he led the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Maſter <hi>Lydyat</hi> alſo ſheweth the ſame, not onely by mentioning this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Manetho,</hi> but by adding thereunto that this was hee <hi>Qui ab Hippotamo raptus interiiſſe fertur:</hi> which though it be taken as a Fable, yet (ſaith he, and not amiſſe) it is <hi>digna at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentione fabula;</hi> a Table well worthy of attention.</p>

                     <p>The next after this was the one and twentieth <hi>Dynaſtie:</hi> to which (not without cauſe) <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives 130. yeares, and reckoneth it in theſe Kings; <hi>Semendes.</hi> 26. <hi>Pſuſennes</hi> 41. <hi>Nephercheres</hi> 4. <hi>Amenophthis</hi> 9. <hi>Opſochon</hi> 6. <hi>Spinaces</hi> 9. <hi>Pſuſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> 35.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe I take to bethe ſame whom other Authors call <hi>Cephrenes.</hi> The ſecond I thinke to be <hi>Cheops</hi> or <hi>Chembis Memphites,</hi> who (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſaith) reigned 1000. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 180. <hi>Olympiad;</hi> and built the greateſt of the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> which (as he alſo ſaith) was twenty yeares in building. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phercheres</hi> might be <hi>Cherinus,</hi> or <hi>Mycerinus. Opſochon</hi> might be <hi>Alychis.</hi> And the laſt <hi>Pſuſennes</hi> might be <hi>Chabeas,</hi> or <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Or rather (which is moſt probable) let ſome of theſe be lookt upon as Viceroyes, reigning under <hi>Chembis</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breus;</hi> and then this <hi>Dynaſtie</hi> will not have more then three chief Kings, though it might and did laſt 130. years. And they were theſe, <hi>Semendes</hi> or <hi>Chephrenes,</hi> to whom we may give 24. yeares. <hi>Chembis</hi> (or as <hi>Herodotus</hi> cals him) <hi>Cheops</hi> 50. yeares. <hi>Chabreus</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aphreus;</hi> or (as he is otherwiſe called) <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aphres</hi> 56. yeares. All which ſummes put together, do make 130. There is no great ſcruple ſure in all this, unleſſe it be that <hi>Chephrenes</hi> is ſet before <hi>Cheops;</hi> and indeed that ſcruple would be removed, which cannot be unleſſe we ſet him after <hi>Cheops.</hi> Take them therefore thus; that as he whom <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> cals <hi>Cheops, Diodorus</hi> cals <hi>Chembis:</hi> ſo he whom <hi>Diodorus</hi> cals <hi>Chabreus, Herodotus</hi> cals <hi>Chephrenes.</hi> The firſt of which (namely <hi>Cheops</hi>) reigned fifty yeares; the ſecond (namely <hi>Chephrenes</hi>) 56.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Kingdome of</hi> Sycionia, <hi>and of the Kings that reigned there.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe next Kingdome which by the courſe of time of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelfe, is the Kingdome of <hi>Sycionia.</hi> It was at the firſt called <hi>Aegialea,</hi> from <hi>Aegialeus</hi> the firſt King thereof, who began to reigne in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2616. Afterwards it was called <hi>Apia,</hi> of <hi>Apis</hi> the fourth King; and then <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> of <hi>Pelops,</hi> as being <hi>Peninſula Pelopis:</hi> and after that, it came to be called <hi>Sycionia</hi> of <hi>Sycion</hi> the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> King thereof. The <hi>Sycionians</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pauſanias</hi>) bordering upon <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> ſay that <hi>Aegialeus</hi> was their firſt King, that he came out of that part of <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> that is called <hi>Aegialos</hi> after him and dwelt firſt in the City <hi>Aegialea,</hi> where the Tower ſtood then, where the Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> is now.</p>
                     <p>In a word, <hi>Sycionia</hi> at the firſt was but a ſmall Region in <hi>Achia;</hi> but the Kings thereof inlarged their Dominions, through all <hi>Achaia,</hi> and made <hi>Sycion</hi> their Seat; as <hi>Ludovicus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ives</hi> noteth.</p>
                     <p>This Kingdome continued from hence, to the death of <hi>Zeuxippus,</hi> 992. yeares; as I find in <hi>Euſebius.</hi> After which, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo's</hi> Prieſts reigned thirty two; even untill the returne of the <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> at eighty yeares after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy.</hi> And note that by this account thus fixed, the <hi>Theban</hi> Warre (in the dayes of <hi>Adraſtus</hi>) will be juſt thirty ſeven years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall of <hi>Troy:</hi> and ſo <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſaith it ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Euſebius</hi> likewiſe gives us the particular reigne of each King, thus, <hi>Aegialeus</hi> 52. <hi>Europs</hi> 45. <hi>Selchin</hi> or <hi>Telchin.</hi> 20. <hi>Apis</hi> 25. <hi>Thelaſion</hi> 52. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> calleth this King by the name <hi>Thelxion,</hi> and ſaith he had ſo happy a reigne, that when he was dead the <hi>Sycionians</hi> adored him as a god with Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Playes; of which it is ſaid, they were the firſt Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. After <hi>Thelaſion Aegydius</hi> reigned thirty foure yeares.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115738:148"/>Then was <hi>Thurimachus</hi> 45. At his Tombe the <hi>Syoionians</hi> uſed to offer Sacrifice, as the ſaid Father alſo ſaith. After <hi>Thuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> was <hi>Leucippus,</hi> he reigned 53. <hi>Moſſapius</hi> or <hi>Meſſapius</hi> 47. <hi>Eratus</hi> or <hi>Peratus</hi> 46. <hi>Plemneus</hi> 48. <hi>Or thopolis</hi> 63. <hi>Marathon</hi> 30. <hi>Marathus</hi> 20. <hi>Echyreus</hi> 55. <hi>Corax</hi> 30. <hi>Epopeus</hi> 35, he built a Temple to <hi>Minerva,</hi> by reaſon of the good ſucceſſe he had againſt <hi>Nyctaeus,</hi> the Brother <hi>Lycus</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Thebes,</hi> as ſome ſuppoſe. Next after him was <hi>Lamedon</hi> 40. Then was <hi>Sycion</hi> 45. and of him the Country was called <hi>Sycionia. Polybus</hi> was next after him, and reigned 40. Then <hi>Janiſchus</hi> (whom <hi>Euſebius</hi> cals <hi>Inachus</hi>) 42. After him <hi>Phaeſtus</hi> 8. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> (in whoſe time was the <hi>Theban</hi> Warre) 4. <hi>Polyphydes</hi> 31. <hi>Pelaſgus</hi> 20. And laſt of all <hi>Zeuxippus</hi> 32.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Dynaſtie</hi> next after theſe, were the Prieſts of <hi>Apollo's</hi> Temple: who reigned as followeth.

                     </head>
                     <p>THe Kingdome of <hi>Argos</hi> is that which is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered next: the firſt King thereof was <hi>Inachus,</hi> who reigned fifty yeares, and began to reigne in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2852. which was 1086. yeares before the firſt yeare of the firſt <hi>Olympiad.</hi> This King was the Father of <hi>Jo,</hi> whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> defloured, and (perceiving that <hi>Juno</hi> eſpied his act) turned her into a Cow. Which is to be underſtood after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> that being defloured by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and not knowing how to abide the fury of her Father, ſhe fled away by Sea into <hi>Egypt,</hi> in a Ship called the Cow which <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:115738:149"/>provided for her: and being there ſhe taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Tillage, and the uſe of Letters, for which ſhe was called by the <hi>Egyptians Iſis,</hi> and Deified by them.</p>
                     <p>The next after <hi>Inachus</hi> was <hi>Phoroneus,</hi> he reigned 60 yeares and was called a Judge becauſe he made Lawes to decide Controverſies among his people, and was one of them that judged in a Controverſie betweene <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Neptune.</hi> And hereupon ſome alſo think that <hi>Forum</hi> [the name of a place to plead in] came firſt from hence, but how truly (ſaith <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi>) looke they to that.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oroſius</hi> ſaith that the <hi>Thelciſſans</hi> and <hi>Carſathians</hi> warred upon him; but he vanquiſhed them, and drove them to ſeeke a new habitation by the Sea. <hi>Plato</hi> calleth him the firſt man, becauſe he firſt taught the <hi>Greekes</hi> civility and Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry. Others ſay as much of <hi>Argus;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Of</hi> Ogyges <hi>and his Flood.</hi>
                        </note> as I ſhall afterward men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when I come to ſpeake of him. <hi>Ogyges</hi> reigned in <hi>Attica</hi> in this Kings time, 1020. yeares before the firſt <hi>Olympiad;</hi> which therfore was in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2918. Two and thirty yeares from whence (for ſo long <hi>Ogyges</hi> reigned, according to <hi>Cedrenus</hi>) was that great and notable Flood, which was called the <hi>Ogygian</hi> Food, both becauſe it hapned in the Country wherein he reigned, and alſo becauſe he was drowned in it. For indeed the Flood which beares his name drowned him and his whole Country: which for 204 yeares after lay void, untill <hi>Cecrops</hi> his reigne there. <hi>Africanus</hi> (in <hi>Euſeb. lib,</hi> 10. <hi>De praeparat. Evang. cap.</hi> 3.) reckons not ſo many by five yeares for this void ſpace: howbeit I find by carefull computation, as many as I have mentioned, and doe begin <hi>Ogyges</hi> reigne 1020 yeares before the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> and ſo alſo doth <hi>Africanus.</hi> This Flood therefore, of which I now ſpeake, was in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 2950. which was the 49<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeare of <hi>Phoroneus</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Argos. Euſebius</hi> placeth it much about the ſame time: and whereas <hi>Cedre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> accounteth. 248. yeares from hence to the Flood of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> I ſhall afterward ſhew whether that be ſo or no. <hi>Deucalians</hi> Flood was great, but this was greater, extending it ſelfe to the bankes of <hi>Archi-pelago</hi> or the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea; drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115738:150"/>likewiſe the Regions of <hi>Artica</hi> about <hi>Athens,</hi> and that of <hi>Achaia</hi> in <hi>Peloponeſus:</hi> at which time the Cities <hi>Helice</hi> and <hi>Bura</hi> (which were ſeated on the North part of <hi>Peloponeſus</hi>) were alſo ſwallowed up.</p>
                     <p>The next King after <hi>Phoroneus</hi> was <hi>Apis;</hi> he reigned thirty five yeares. That which ſome write of this King, <hi>viz.</hi> that he went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and dying there was called <hi>Serapis,</hi> the greateſt god of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſeemes rather to belong to <hi>Oſyris</hi> the Husband of <hi>Iſis.</hi> For <hi>Apis</hi> in their language ſignifies an Oxe, which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> worſhipped either from the inſtitution of <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Oſyris,</hi> in regard of the uſe that they found out of this Beaſt in Tillage, or for the honour of <hi>Oſyris</hi> whoſe ſoule they ſay went into an Oxe, and remaineth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Oxe <hi>Apis,</hi> paſſing from one <hi>Apis</hi> to another: or elſe it was in regard that <hi>Iſis</hi> gathered together the ſcattered members of <hi>Oſyris,</hi> when <hi>Typhon</hi> had ſlaine him, and put them into a woodden Oxe covered with an Oxes hide; which when the people ſaw, they beleeved that <hi>Oſyris</hi> was become an Oxe, and ſo began to adore that, as if it had been him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Next after <hi>Apis, Argus</hi> reigned: the time of his reigne was ſeventy yeares. Of him the Country was called <hi>Argos,</hi> and the People <hi>Argives:</hi> For till now the Countrey bore the name of <hi>Peloponeſus;</hi> or (as ſome thinke) was formerly called <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> or <hi>Pelaſgia. Homer</hi> calleth it <hi>Argos Pelaſgicum,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Iſaacſon</hi> mentioneth in his Chronologie.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo written that in <hi>Argus</hi> his time <hi>Greece</hi> began to
<note n="*" place="margin">Namely better then before.</note> know Husbandry and Tillage, and that after his death he was accounted for a god, and honoured with Temples and Sacrifices; which honour a private man, one <hi>Homogyrus,</hi> had before him, becauſe he was the firſt among them who ever yoaked Oxen to the Plow: howbeit he was ſlaine with Thunder, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> noteth in the ſixth Chapter of his eighteenth booke <hi>De civit. Dei.</hi> But if <hi>Iſis</hi> before this, carried the knowledge of theſe things out of <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that <hi>Phoroneus</hi> alſo before mentioned, was (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) the firſt man, becauſe he firſt taught the <hi>Greekes</hi> civility and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115738:150"/>Husbandry; then muſt this which is here attributed to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> be underſtood of a more full and perfect knowledge then they had at the firſt: for it is eaſier to add then to invent, which therefore makes things come to perfection but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Criaſus</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Argus,</hi> and reigned after him fifty foure yeares. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith that <hi>Prometheus</hi> and his brother <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> were famous in the dayes of <hi>Saphrus</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Sphaerus,</hi> or <hi>Iphaereus</hi> whilſt <hi>Criaſus</hi> reigned ſtill in <hi>Argos, lib.</hi> 18 <hi>De civit. Dei, cap.</hi> 8. The firſt of theſe <hi>viz. Prometheus,</hi> is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have formed men out of Clay: which was, becauſe he was an excellent teacher of wiſedome. And as for that ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo, of his ſtealing away of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Fire: by it is meant either that he firſt taught to ſtrike Fire with a Flint; or elſe that his knowledge reached to the very Starres; For he was a great <hi>Aſtronomer,</hi> and did thereupon aſcend to the Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> where 9with a reſtleſſe deſire) he uſed to ſearch out the natures, motions, and influences of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies. His Brother was alſo a great <hi>Astronomer:</hi> from whence aroſe that Fable of his ſupporting Heaven with his Shoulders.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phorbas</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Criaſus,</hi> and reigned after him thirty five yeares. This King <hi>Phorbas</hi> (in the thirteenth yeare of his reigne tooke <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and cleared it from venemous Beaſts, with which the Country had been infected: for which, he and his Wife were deified after their deaths, as <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> tell us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Triopas</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Phorbas,</hi> and reigned after him forty ſix yeares.</p>
                     <p>Next after <hi>Triopas</hi> was <hi>Crolopus,</hi> whoſe time of reigne was twenty one yeares. In his dayes (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> mentioneth out of <hi>Tatianus</hi>) was <hi>Phaetous</hi> burning, and <hi>Deucalions</hi> Flood: to which the account of <hi>Varro</hi> well agreeth: who ſaith that the Flood of <hi>Deucalion</hi> was in the dayes of <hi>Cranaus</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Athens,</hi> who (as I ſhall afterward ſhew you) was contemporary to this King <hi>Crotopus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next after <hi>Crotopus,</hi> was <hi>Stethnelas,</hi> he reigned eleven
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115738:151"/>yeares, and was the ninth King of <hi>Argos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gelanor</hi> being about to ſucceed him, is expulſed by <hi>Danaus,</hi> who being driven out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by his Brother, arriveth in <hi>Greece,</hi> and there gets the Kingdome of <hi>Argos,</hi> in which he reigned 50. yeares. For when he was driven out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he came (as I ſaid) into <hi>Greece</hi> among the <hi>Argives:</hi> and being come among them, he contended with <hi>Gelanor</hi> about the Kingdome; in which contention the People were to umpire. And when much was ſaid on both ſides, <hi>Danaus</hi> ſeemed to ſpeake as good reaſon as the other: whereupon they could not determine untill the next day. And on the next day a Wolfe comes hurling into the Paſture, where he begins a fight with the chiefe Bull of the Kings Heard: which when the People ſaw, they attended the iſſue; and finding that the Wolfe had the hap to kill the Bull, they gave the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on <hi>Danaus</hi> his ſide. For as the Wolfe is a ſtranger to Man, ſo was <hi>Danaus</hi> to them: but becauſe the Wolfe overcame <hi>Danaus</hi> muſt reigne, and <hi>Gelanor</hi> be expulſed. This was 382. yeares after this Kingdome of <hi>Argos</hi> firſt began. And note that this King was the firſt that digged Wels in <hi>Argos,</hi> who alſo becauſe of the Wolfe that ſeemed to predict his good Fortune, built and dedicated a Temple to <hi>Apollo Lycius.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he was ſlain by his Sonne in Law <hi>Lynceus</hi> who reigned after him one and forty yeares: the Story of which is as followeth.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Danaus</hi> (of whom we ſpeake) ruled firſt in <hi>Egypt</hi> nine yeares for his brother <hi>Sethoſis,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> in which time it was told him by the Oracle, that he ſhould one day be ſlaine by a man who ſhould be his Sonne in law. For feare of which Prediction, he refuſed to marry his daughters, and would not thereupon give them to the Sonnes of his Brother, although his Brother did earneſtly deſire it. For which denyall (together with other things, wherein he had by his miſrule, offended his Brother) <hi>Aegyptus</hi> his ſaid Brother expelled him out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by force, and comming (as hath been ſaid into <hi>Argos,</hi> was received there as King, in the ſtead
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115738:151"/>of <hi>Gelanor.</hi> Thither did <hi>Aegyptus</hi> ſend his Sonnes after him, with command, either to marry his daughters, or to kill him. Which charge they purſued ſo well, that they forced him to condiſcend, that they ſhould enjoy them; yet ſo, that he gave to every Daughter privately a Sword, with charge to kill their Husbands. All of them executed his will, except <hi>Hypemneſtra,</hi> who diſcovered the Plot to <hi>Lynceus</hi> her Husband, and thereupon he ſaved himſelfe by flight. Now this diſobedience cauſed <hi>Danaus</hi> to arraign his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but ſhe was acquit by the <hi>Argives:</hi> howbeit her Father would not releaſe her, but kept her ſtill in priſon. After this, <hi>Lynceus</hi> returned from <hi>Egypt</hi> with ſo ces, ſlew <hi>Danaus,</hi> releaſed his Wife <hi>Hypemneſtra,</hi> and poſſeſſed her Fathers Kingdome: which (as I ſaid before) he held for the ſpace of 41 yeares. The lives of the other Siſters, were ſpared for <hi>Hypemneſtra's</hi> ſake, but imbarked in a Ship without Pilot, Maſt, or Saile, and ſo committed to the mercy of the Sea: where for a time floating up and downe, they are at the laſt (as I find in ſome Authors) caſt upon the Iſle of <hi>Albion,</hi> which was then inhabited by <hi>Gyants,</hi> who on them begat Children of their owne proportion. And for all this, Maſter <hi>Iſaackſon</hi> quotes <hi>Juſtin, Pauſanias, Higinus, Virgil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next after <hi>Lynceus,</hi> was the reigne of <hi>Abas;</hi> he was the Father of <hi>Praetus,</hi> and <hi>Acriſius,</hi> and reigned 23. yeares: Of him the <hi>Argive</hi> Kings were called <hi>Abantiadae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Proetas</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Abas,</hi> and reigned 17. yeares. His three Daughters called the <hi>Proetides</hi>) were ſo extreamly proud of their owne beauties, that they fell mad, and were cured by <hi>Melampus</hi> with <hi>Hellebour:</hi> which ever ſince hath been called <hi>Melampodium.</hi> He had the one of them given him for his cure, and was married to her. And of this man <hi>Melampus,</hi> it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid; that he underſtood the notes of Birds, and the voice of Beaſts, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> writeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Acriſius</hi> (the laſt King of <hi>Argos</hi>) ſucceeded <hi>Proetus,</hi> and reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after him 31. yeares. He was accidentally ſlaine by his Grandchild <hi>Perſeus,</hi> the Sonne of his Daughter <hi>Danae;</hi> who thereupon forſooke this Country of <hi>Argos,</hi> and founded this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115738:152"/>Kingdome at <hi>Mycenae.</hi> For we are to know that <hi>Acriſius</hi> had a daughter called <hi>Danae,</hi> whom he ſequeſtered to a <hi>Tower,</hi> and there kept her private; becauſe the <hi>Oracle</hi> had told him that her ſonne ſhould kill him. Now <hi>Jupiter</hi> hearing of the ſame of her beauty, and finding no meanes to come to her, deſcended (as is ſaid) into her lap, through the roofe of the <hi>Tower,</hi> in a ſhower of Gold, and had thereby the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to get her with childe: By which is meant, that he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted her keepers with gold, and thereupon had liberty to worke his will. At laſt ſhe was delivered of a ſonne, even of this ſonne <hi>Perſeus:</hi> which when <hi>Acriſius</hi> her Father came to know, he forthwith cauſed her and the childe to be incloſed in a Cheſt, and caſt into the Sea. The Cheſt was driven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coaſt of <hi>Apulia,</hi> and taken up by Fiſhermen, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her and the childe in it, preſented them to <hi>Pylumnus</hi> the King, to whom ſhe was married. <hi>Perſeus</hi> after this, being growne to be a man, did many valiant exploits, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>Argos</hi> where he practiſed the throwing of the quoit, did by miſchance braine his Grand-father <hi>Acriſius</hi> with one of them: and ſo ended the Kingdome of <hi>Argos,</hi> For when <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſaw what he had done, he tranſlated the Kingdome from thence to <hi>Mycenae.</hi> Some ſay that this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happened whilſt he indeavoured to ſhew his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the invention of the <hi>Diſcus,</hi> or Leaden ball: for whilſt <hi>Acriſius</hi> was more curious to ſee what was done, then care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to avoid the danger that might betide him, he came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dint of what was throwne (whether Quoit, or Ball of Lead) and ſo was ſlain.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt now ſet downe the Kings already mentioned, in their right times, and preſent them in one Liſt at once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for thee. After which I ſhall proceed to the Kingdome of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenae:</hi> in which I ſhall meet with difficultie more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, becauſe the Kings of that Kingdome are ſcarce right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly computed by any Author that I have ſeen. <hi>Petavius</hi> in his <hi>Rat. Temp.</hi> comes neareſt to truth, as will be afterward ſhewed.</p>

                     <p>I come therefore now to that of <hi>Mycenae:</hi> in the handling of which that I may account aright, I ſhall crave a little leave to depart away from the common path. For, as is commonly accounted, <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Sthenelus</hi> had but eight yeares together: whereas <hi>Perſeus</hi> alone had not leſſe then one and thirty yeares, becauſe mention is made of the two and thirtieth yeare of his reigne as may be ſeen in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> his tenth Booke, and his third Chapter <hi>De Praeparatione E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelica.</hi> After theſe two, <hi>Euristheus</hi> reigned 38 ſay ſome, 43. ſay others. Then <hi>Atreus</hi> and <hi>Thyeſtes</hi> 65. and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> 15. After him <hi>Aegyſtus</hi> 7. <hi>Oreſtes</hi> 70. and laſt of all <hi>Tiſamenus, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilus,</hi> and <hi>Cometes</hi> 3. among them: the end whereof muſt be at 80. yeares after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy;</hi> as <hi>Velleius</hi> ſheweth, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>The years of theſe laſt, after <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> I think may paſſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115738:153"/>as they, are except (with Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>) I reckon ſix, and not ſeven to <hi>Aegyſtus;</hi> or elſe account ſome one of their years after <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to be but current. And as for <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> himſelfe, that he ſhould have but 15 is contrary to what <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> writeth in the Chapter and book aforeſaid, where (agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>) he telleth us that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> reigned 18. yeares in the laſt whereof <hi>Troy</hi> was taken. Then for <hi>Atreus</hi> and <hi>Thyeſtes,</hi> that they together ſhould have 65. yeares, is nothing probable: for (as <hi>Petavius</hi> proveth out of <hi>Thucidides</hi> and <hi>Iſocrates</hi>) it is not to be doubted but that <hi>Euryſtheus</hi> (predeceſſor to them) was ſlaine by the poſterity of <hi>Hercules</hi> after <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelfe was dead. To which (ſaith he) <hi>Diodorus</hi> addeth, ſaying; the poſterity of <hi>Hercules</hi> fought againſt <hi>Euryſtheus,</hi> having <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Hyllus</hi> for their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. Have an eye then to the time when <hi>Theſeus</hi> both began and ended his reigne, and ſee whether the time of <hi>Euryſtheus</hi> can poſſibly be thruſt up ſo high as the 65. yeares of <hi>Atreus</hi> and <hi>Thyeſtes</hi> will croud it. More like it is that they two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, had not above ſix yeares: For the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> of <hi>Thucidides</hi> ſets downe the time of the <hi>Heraclidae's</hi> firſt erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> to be twenty yeares before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Troy;</hi> and the latter to be 80. yeares after it was deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>But (ſaith <hi>Petavius</hi> their firſt comming in, is to be taken two wayes: For in the beginning thereof, they (with their Captains <hi>Jolaus, Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Hillus</hi>) fought againſt <hi>Euryſtheus,</hi> and he being ſlaine they enjoyed <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> for about a yeare, untill by peſtilence they were driven out. Then in the third yeare after, they come againe (even juſt twenty yeares before the deſtruction of <hi>Troy</hi>) when <hi>Hyllus</hi> concluded with <hi>Atreus</hi> the ſucceſſor of <hi>Euryſtheus,</hi> that if hee <hi>(viz. Hyllus)</hi> were overcome in ſingle fight the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> ſhould depart to the place from whence they came, and not returne into <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſus</hi> againe untill an hundred yeares after. Now it ſo fell out that <hi>Hyllus</hi> was ſlain; they thereupon depart as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and returne not againe untill the time appointed, which being an hundred yeares after, and yet but 80. yeares
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115738:153"/>after the fall of <hi>Troy;</hi> muſt needs declare that <hi>Hyllus</hi> was ſlaine twenty yeares before <hi>Troy</hi> was deſtroyed, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3510 three years before which (<hi>viz.</hi> in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3507.) <hi>Euryſtheus</hi> was ſlaine. In that yeare therefore of his death was the firſt yeare of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treus,</hi> who (together with his Partner in reigne <hi>Thyeſtes</hi>) could have but ſix yeares, if <hi>Agamemnon</hi> have eighteen. And that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had eighteen rather then fifteene, is witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (as I ſaid before) by <hi>Clemens</hi> in <hi>Euſebius;</hi> who ſaith that <hi>Troy</hi> was taken in the eighteenth yeare of his reigne. Nor doth <hi>Euſebius</hi> himſelfe but record ſo many yeares for the whole reigne of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> though he wrongfully coupleth his fifteenth with the fall of <hi>Troy,</hi> which is indeed the onely reaſon why ſome Authors ſay, that he had but fifteene years of reigne. For if <hi>Troy</hi> was taken in his fifteenth yeare, then muſt that be his laſt, becauſe at his returne from thence he was ſlain by <hi>Aegyſtus,</hi> ſet on to do it by the ſuggeſtion of <hi>Clytemneſtra Agamemnons</hi> owne Wife, who in the abſence of her Husband, and whilſt he was at the Seige of <hi>Troy,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Adultery with <hi>Aegyſtus,</hi> and now (together with him) defileth her hands with Blood, as before for the ſatisfying of her wicked luſt, ſhe had filthily defiled her Husbands bed; and ſo in concluſion adds murther and Adultery both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But it was not the fifteenth, but eighteenth year of this gallant King when the <hi>Greekes</hi> tooke <hi>Troy,</hi> according to the Teſtimony aforeſaid: and therefore we muſt not account leſſe then eighteene yeares for <hi>Agamemnon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>Perſeus</hi> the firſt King of this Kingdome, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as I ſaid before) is made of the two and thirtieth years of his reigne: but how much he reigned longer is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Onely that he began in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3396. I am very confident, and have reaſon for it; For firſt <hi>Danaus</hi> was baniſhed out of <hi>Egypt</hi> nine yeares after King <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> was drowned in the <hi>Red-Sea:</hi> which therefore makes his baniſhment to be in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3233. and conſequently his beginning to reigne in <hi>Argos</hi> in the year of the ſame <hi>Period</hi> 3234. Which time of <hi>Danaus</hi> being
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115738:154"/>thus fixed, ſerves well to direct us both to the beginning and end of the Kingdome of <hi>Argos,</hi> and conſequently for the beginning of the Kingdome of <hi>Mycenae,</hi> whoſe firſt King was (as already hath been ſaid) King <hi>Perſeus,</hi> Secondly, the two and thirtieth yeare of <hi>Perſeus</hi> before mentioned was 63. years before the expedition of the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> and therefore in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 3427. which thereupon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to the beginning of his reigne in the year of the ſame <hi>Period</hi> 3396. And that it was ſo long before that expedition, is mentioned by <hi>Euſebius</hi> out of <hi>Apollodorus in libro de tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> But you will ſay, when and in what year was that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition? I anſwer it was in the end of the reigne of <hi>Laome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and in the beginning of the reigne of <hi>Priamus;</hi> as <hi>Helvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> hath well obſerved. Now <hi>Priamus</hi> we know reigned but till the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> which was deſtroyed in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 3530. 408. years before the beginning of the <hi>Olympiads</hi> of <hi>Iphitus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Diod. lib.</hi> 14.</note> and 432 before <hi>Rome</hi> was built. <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> therefore muſt needs begin to reigne in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 3490, for he reigned forty years, and no more; as <hi>Bucholcerus,</hi> out of <hi>Archilochus</hi> hath recorded. And if <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> began to reign then, it will follow that then alſo was the expedition of the <hi>Argonauts:</hi> how elſe could it be in the end of the reigne of <hi>Laomedon,</hi> and beginning of <hi>Priamus,</hi> as <hi>Helvicus</hi> ſaith it was.</p>
                     <p>And thus we have the beginning and ending of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Argos</hi> rightly fixed, and conſequently the beginning of the Kingdome of <hi>Mycenae:</hi> but how long <hi>Perſeus</hi> reigned is ſtill unknowne. Probable it is that he and his ſonne <hi>Stethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> had together ſixty ſix years, <hi>Euryſtheus</hi> 45. <hi>Atreus</hi> and <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtes</hi> ſix, <hi>Agamemnon</hi> 18. <hi>Aegyſtus</hi> ſix, <hi>Oreſtes</hi> 70. <hi>Tiſamenus, Penthilus,</hi> and <hi>Cometes</hi> three: theſe ended in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 3610. at that deſcent of the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> which was foure ſcore years after the fall of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Know alſo that the <hi>Olympiads</hi> of <hi>Hercules</hi> began 442. years before thoſe of <hi>Iphitus,</hi> as is reckoned by <hi>Clemens</hi> out of an old ancient Chronologer, after which he lived not above nine years, as is very probable; and therefore dyed in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115738:154"/>year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 3505. upon whoſe death, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are baniſhed by <hi>Euryſtheus,</hi> for feare they ſhould deprive him of his Kingdome. But by this feare he wrought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a miſchiefe: for hereupon it came to paſſe that by two years after they came againſt him and deſtroyed him, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>But now ſee a Catalogue of theſe in their right times, as near as in all probability can be gathered.</p>

                     <p>In the meane time I begin with <hi>Cecrops,</hi> who reigned fifty years, and began in the year of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 3154. It is reported that he was of a double ſhape; his upper part like a man, and his lower part like a beaſt; but this is a fable. For he was indeed called

Or elſe being taller then other men, he was as if he had the proportion of two men. Or finally, he was called <hi>Diphyes</hi> becauſe he taught the people civility, and did alſo inſtitute a ſtrict obſervance of the matrimoniall band and ſociety, taking order that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould be deprived of that licenſious liberty which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was a little too common among them: this therefore made ſome ſay, that he was man in his upper parts; but his lower were feminine, as <hi>Ludovicus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ives</hi> noteth. When he began to repaire the City where he reigned; called after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Athens:</hi> an Olive tree grew ſodenly up in one place, and a fountain burſt as ſodenly out in another. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies drave the King to <hi>Delphos,</hi> to know the <hi>Oracles</hi> minde; whoſe anſwer was, that the Olive tree ſignified <hi>Minerva,</hi> and the fountain <hi>Neptune,</hi> and that the City might be called after which of theſe the people pleaſed. Hereupon <hi>Cecrops</hi> gathered all the people of both ſexes together, to make their Election, the men being for <hi>Neptune,</hi>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115738:155"/>them. Firſt, that thenceforth no woman ſhould be admitted to any conſultation. Secondly, that none after that time ſhould be named after the name of their mother.

This Flood was in <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> where <hi>Deucalion</hi> then was King: For we are to note that he reigned in <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> neare the mount of <hi>Pernaſus;</hi> But it extended farther then ſo.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115738:157"/>Rigging, in token of the great ſorrow that was in <hi>Athens</hi> at his departure; but chiefly in <hi>Aegeus</hi> his Father, who gave command to his Sonne that if his hap were ſo good as to ſlay the <hi>Minotaure,</hi> he ſhould change his Sailes from blacke to white at his comming home againe. Now it ſo fell out that <hi>Theſeus</hi> (by <hi>Ariadnes</hi> advice) ſlew the <hi>Minotaure:</hi> but at his returne being overjoyed with his good fortune, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat to alter his Sailes. Whereupon it came to paſſe, that his Father <hi>Aegeus,</hi> looking from an high Tower, and ſeeing the Ship to come back with Blacke Sailes, thought his Sonne to be dead: and for griefe thereof he preſently caſt himſelfe into the Sea, and was drowned. Which Sea wasever after cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of <hi>Aegean-Sea.</hi> But as for this <hi>Theſeus</hi> he was Coſin German to <hi>Hercules;</hi> to whom he was aſſiſtant in many of his Labors.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Coelius Rhodiginus</hi> relates this ſtory otherwiſe, and ſaith that her name whom theſe two came to ſteale, was <hi>Cora</hi> the daughter of <hi>Ades:</hi> and that they went to the River <hi>Acheron</hi> there to have done it. Which I like better then to call her <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> becauſe that Rape was long before this; and was either in the dayes of <hi>Ericthonius,</hi> or in the dayes of <hi>Ericthius</hi> as I have already mentioned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mneſtheus</hi> was the next King of <hi>Athens,</hi> who attained the Kingdome through the faction of <hi>Helen's</hi> bretheren, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled <hi>Theſeus</hi> and made him King.

                        <hi>Demophoon</hi> reigned next, but was none of his Son. For <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoon</hi> was the Son of <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Phaedra,</hi> who upon the death

This was the laſt King of <hi>Athens,</hi> who for the good of his Country put himſelfe into a diſguiſe that he might be ſlame. For when the Kings of <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> (who deſcended from <hi>Hercules</hi>) warred upon <hi>Athens,</hi> it was told them by the <hi>Oracle</hi> that they ſhould conquer if they killed not the <hi>Athem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> King: hereupon they concealed (as much as they could) the anſwer of the <hi>Oracle,</hi> and withall gave a ſtrict charge that none ſhould touch <hi>Codrus.</hi> But the <hi>Athenians</hi> hearing of this <hi>Oracle, Codrus</hi> being deſirous of glory and the good of his Country, diſguiſed himſelfe, went into the Camp of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and falling to brable with the Souldiers was flaine: from whence

This was about three yeares after he came into this Country: for he came hither about the ſecond or third year after that City was deſtroyed. Soon after his comming he married <hi>Lavinia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Latinus,</hi> and built <hi>Lavinium.</hi> Then, when <hi>Latinus</hi> was ſlaine in the Warre with the <hi>Rutili,</hi> and leaving no iſſue Male behind him, he ſucceedeth in the Kingdome: but is warred againſt by <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (formerly betroathed to <hi>Lavinia</hi>) but in this Warre <hi>Turnus</hi> is ſlaine by <hi>Aeneas:</hi> and hee alſo ſlain afterward in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Warre with <hi>Mezentius</hi> King of <hi>Tuſcanie,</hi> after he had reigned three yeares.</p>

                        <hi>Aſcanius</hi> was his Succeſſor, with whom alſo <hi>Mezentius</hi> waged Warre, and beſieged him ſo ſtreightly in <hi>Lavinium,</hi> that he was glad to crave for peace, but could not have it unleſſe upon hard conditions: whereupon he ſallied out ſuddainly, and ſlew <hi>Lauſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Mezentius</hi> which put that Army into ſuch a feare, that <hi>Mezentius</hi> not only condiſcended to peace upon equall termes, but ever after remained a true friend to <hi>Aſcanius.</hi> His Father was <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and his Mother (not <hi>Lavinia</hi> but) <hi>Creuſa.</hi> For though <hi>Lavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> were with child by <hi>Aeneas,</hi> yet ſhe was not delivered till after her Husbands death.

But <hi>Verſtegan</hi> proves all this to be fabulous, and admireth much to ſee how many people have ſought to derive their diſcents from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and how that many foundations of Cities are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have laid by them. Yea (ſaith he) the follies of men have been ſuch, that they have given the glory to the fugitive People, of almoſt all that is excellent in all <hi>Europe.</hi> This therefore would be wiſely conſidered: for it ſtandeth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115738:162"/>with farre more likelihood of truth, that we hold him for ſome

                           <hi>Alſtedius</hi> ſaith he came into <hi>France</hi> out of <hi>Italy</hi> &amp; was at the firſt a King of a people there, called <hi>Rutuli:</hi> and that he was droven thence by <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
                        </note> Prince of <hi>Gallia</hi> from whence he came when he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved here in this Iſland then called <hi>Albion:</hi> where conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the preſent Inhabitants, he ſetled himſelfe, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the rule and dominion over the whole Land, which now after him the Conqueror muſt be called <hi>Brittain.</hi> At the time of his death he divided the whole into three parts, and left them to be governed by his three Sonnes; <hi>Locrine, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banact</hi> and <hi>Camber.</hi> Vnto <hi>Locrine</hi> who was the eldeſt, he left <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egria,</hi> now called <hi>England.</hi> Vnto <hi>Albanact</hi> the ſecond Sonne, he allotted <hi>Albania,</hi> now called <hi>Scotland:</hi> and unto <hi>Camber,</hi> the third Sonne he gave <hi>Cambria,</hi> now called <hi>Wales.</hi> And all this when he had reigned twenty foure yeares: namely, twenty after he built <hi>London,</hi> and foure before. This was the firſt King.</p>
                     <p>The next (as I ſaid) was <hi>Locrine:</hi> of whom and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, I intend to make no large diſcourſe, but ſhall rather endeavour to ſet downe the Kings and yeares that they reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as punctually as I can, not varying from what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accounted, except upon good ground for the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling of this Story to other Hiſtories. And to effect this I ſhall gather out of ſundry Authors, the years of their reign; following no one, not further then I find juſt cauſe. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe an eye be had not only to the times of <hi>Belinus</hi> and <hi>Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> but alſo to the time of <hi>Coilus</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Coelius,</hi> or <hi>Cecilius</hi>) I beleeve I ſhall produce no truer account then what hath been produced already, by ſuch as have trod this path before me: from which I muſt here and there ſtep a little aſide, the better I ſay to reconcile this Story to other Hiſtories.</p>
                     <p>But firſt, if the <hi>Brittaines</hi> came not from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> it would be ſhewed how the now City of <hi>London</hi> came to be called <hi>Troy novant.</hi>

                     <p>And thus I have proſecuted this Hiſtory of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings thus farre, and liſted them in their right times and order, as neare as I can: and have, as you ſee taken my firſt Riſe from the arrivall of their firſt King <hi>Brutus;</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of <hi>France,</hi> came into this Land (then called <hi>Albion</hi>) and found no other Inhabitants in it, but ſome Gyants which dwelled in Moutaines and Caves; theſe were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by him and his men, the chiefeſt whereof was <hi>Corin,</hi> one of <hi>Brutes</hi> ſtrongeſt Champions, by whom the Gyant <hi>Gogmagog</hi> was ſlaine.</p>
                     <p>But if this Iſland were once a Continent to <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtegan</hi> proveth, in his

And there I have fixed it, even in the yeare of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 3606. and yeare of the World by my account 2897.</p>

And indeed the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count would fit the turne well enough, if all things elſe were correſpondent: but becauſe they are not, I muſt let it alone to them that like it. For though from the fortieth yeare of <hi>Periander</hi> (which was all the time that he reigned, according to <hi>Laertius</hi>) there be 41. years to the time that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſubdued <hi>Croeſus;</hi> yet not ſo many from the end of his 44. at which time he dyed; even in the fourth yeare of the 48. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as already hath been ſhewed. I conclude therefore that when <hi>Croeſus</hi> loſt his Kingdome, it was not the firſt year of the 59. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> but rather and indeed the firſt year of the 58. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> &amp; fourteenth year of his reign. For we are not to account that laſt of his to be compleat, but current, when this calamity fell upon him: and that it was alſo towards Winter, in the yeare of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4166. Which being conſidered I would that the reigne of the <hi>Lydians</hi> be ſet one year higher then they be in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the firſt Part, next after the one hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Page.

                     <p>They reigned without any ſtrict hand over their ſubjects, untill the dayes of <hi>Dioces:</hi> and that's the reaſon why he is accounted by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> as the firſt King. Nor is this my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion alone,
<note place="margin">Hiſt.

For they following the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Arbaces,</hi> had given to the people ſo much licence, as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115738:166"/>cauſed every one to deſire the wholeſome ſeverity of a more Lordly King. Herein <hi>Dioces</hi> anſwered their deſires to the full. For he cauſed them to build for him a ſtately Palace; he tooke unto him a Guard, for the defence of his Perſon; he ſeldome gave preſence which alſo when he did, it was with ſuch auſterity, that no man durſt preſume to ſpit or cough in his fight. By theſe and the like Ceremonies he bred in the people an awfull regard and highly upheld the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, which his Predeceſſors had almoſt letten fall, through neglect of due comportments.</p>
                     <p>In execution of his royall office, he did uprightly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely adminiſter juſtice, keeping ſecret ſpies to informe him of all that was done in the Kingdome. He cared not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the bounds of his Dominion, by encroaching upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but ſtudied how to govern well his owne.</p>
                     <p>The difference found between this King, and ſuch as were before him, ſeemes to have bred that opinion which <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> delivers, that <hi>Dioces</hi> was the firſt who reigned in <hi>Media.</hi> Thus that Knight.</p>
                     <p>Moreover this was he that built the great City of <hi>Echa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> which now is called <hi>Tauris;</hi> and therefore ſhould in all likelihood be that King <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> mentioned in the booke of <hi>Judith:</hi> which even the courſe of time appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
                     <p>But if he be <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> who was it that was that great <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> which fought againſt him. I anſwer, this ſeemes to be <hi>Saoſduchinus</hi> King of the <hi>Aſſirians:</hi> about the beginning of whoſe twelfth year <hi>Dioces</hi> was ſlaine. For ſo it is read in the firſt Chapter of the book of <hi>Judith,</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Latin</hi> out of the <hi>Caldee</hi> by St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> as a worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor well obſerveth, in his laborious and learned Annals of the old Teſtament. In the Greeke indeeed we are one while directed to the twelfth yeare, another while to the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of this King: but that unconſtancie argues a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Copie; and ſo I leave it, comming now to ſhew the courſe of ſucceſſion among theſe Kings of <hi>Media,</hi> who began at the death of <hi>Sardanapalus.</hi>

Now this name ſome thinke was given him for the better lucke ſake: namely as I conceive; That as the ancient <hi>Ninus</hi> did at the firſt enlarge this Kingdome ſo as it came to be a great Monarchy: in like manner the ſame was hoped for by them who gave this name to this King. Or elſe, becauſe he was fortunate in the enlarging of it, they ſaid of him that he was a ſecond <hi>Ninus:</hi> the time of whoſe reigne is gathered out of <hi>Castor</hi> aforeſaid, in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115738:167"/>the Greeke Chronicle of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> to be nine yeares.</p>
                     <p>His Succeſſor I take to be the ſame who in the Scripture is called <hi>Phul,</hi> and came in the dayes of <hi>Menahem</hi> and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 15.19. and 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 5.26. How long he reigned is not expreſſed any where that I know, except it be in the Writings of <hi>Annius,</hi> where we find 48. yeares men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for the time of his reigne. <hi>Tiglath pilezer</hi> ſucceeded him, and (according to the ſaid Author) reigned 25. years, <hi>Salmanaſar</hi> 17. <hi>Senacharib</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>How I ſhould contradict this Author for the reigns of theſe four Kings, I cannot ſee; except it be in the reigne of <hi>Phul,</hi> who (if the reſt be right) muſt have but 43. becauſe after <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacharibs</hi> army was ſlain by the Angel, and that he thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on went ſtreight way home with ſhame to his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he lived not fully fifty five dayes. For before 55. dayes were ended, he was ſlain by his own Sons, <hi>Adramelech</hi> and <hi>Sharezer,</hi> as he was worſhipping in the houſe of <hi>Niſroch</hi> his god, <hi>Tob.</hi> 1.21. and <hi>Eſa.</hi> 37.38. If any further helpe could be had from other Authors, I would not be beholding to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> for thus much: but becauſe it cannot, it wil I hope be no harm to take aime from him ſo farre as he thwarts no other. To the next King (namely <hi>Eſarhaddon;</hi> or, as he is otherwiſe written, <hi>Aſarhaddon</hi>) he giveth ten years, but there I leave him. For it is extreamely probable that he had a longer time then ſo: thirty yeares in <hi>Niniveh;</hi> and after that, twelve yeares more in <hi>Babilon;</hi> In all 42. with ſome odde moneths over &amp; above. For at the end of the eight years of <hi>Interregnum</hi> that were in <hi>Babilon,</hi> the King that began to reigne there was <hi>Aſſaradinus,</hi> as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calleth him in his Mathematical Canon of the Kings of <hi>Babilon:</hi> who in all probability was this <hi>Aſſarhaddon</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Senacharib,</hi> formerly mentioned.</p>

Howbeit, by what we find elſwhere, it may be gathered that there were Kings of <hi>Babilon</hi> after <hi>Sardana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus,</hi> before the <hi>Aera</hi> of this King <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> took beginning as in <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Chronicle may be ſeen, in the beginning, of the reigne of <hi>Arbaces.</hi> For firſt, having ſhewed how the Empire of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> was ſhattered in pieces by the fall of this Epicurious King, he ſaith that the <hi>Medes</hi> brought it home to themſelves; that is, they purchaſed hereby their ancient Liberty: which (with reference to the opinion of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> before mentioned) he ſheweth to be ſo great, that it was as if they had no Princes to reigne over them untill the time of <hi>Dioces;</hi> and yet he ſetteth down four that reigned before him.

                     <p>The next Government was of Conſuls, who began in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4206. There were other alterations
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115738:170"/>afterward: but that which was moſt eminent was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Emperours. The firſt whereof in ſome ſort was <hi>Julius Ceſar,</hi> by whom the Brittains were made tributary in the ninth of <hi>Caſſibelan:</hi> but not till <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was <hi>Rome</hi> fully brought under the command of one Soveraigne Imperiall Monarch. He therefore properly was the firſt Emperour: whoſe death did ſo much greive the people, that they wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either that he had never been borne, or elſe that he had never dyed. <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſucceeded him, and began in the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4727. after his Predeceſſour forementioned had reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 57. years, five moneths, and foure dayes; for <hi>Ceſar</hi> was ſlaine in the Senate houſe (receiving there three and twenty wounds) in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4670. on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of <hi>March:</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> began on the nineteenth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> dyed, even in the year of the ſaid <hi>Period</hi> 4727 aforeſaid, not long before that Eclipſe of the Moon which <hi>Tacitus</hi> mentions.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Tiberius</hi> dyed on the ſixteenth day of <hi>March,</hi> in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4750, after he had reigned 22 years, ſix moneths, and 28 dayes.</p>
                     <p>His ſucceſſour was <hi>Caligula,</hi> who reigned three years ten moneths, and nine dayes: He was ſo prodigall that he ſpent an hundred Millions of money in three years. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowred his three fiſters, and one of their daughters: and was alſo ſo cruell, that he wiſhed all the people of <hi>Rome</hi> to have had but one neck, that he might cut it off at one blow. Finally, he dyed (being ſlaine by <hi>Caſſius, Cherea,</hi> and <hi>Sabinus</hi> the <hi>Tribune</hi>) on the 24 day of <hi>January,</hi> in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4754.</p>
                     <p>His Unckle <hi>Claudius</hi> ſucceeded him, and reighed thirteene years, eight moneths, and ten dayes. In his time was that Famine which <hi>Agabus</hi> foretold, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.28. He commanded all <hi>Jewes</hi> to depart from <hi>Rome, Asts</hi> 18.2. And made <hi>Felix</hi> Governour of <hi>Judea,</hi> who was made to tremble in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Minion <hi>Drauſilla,</hi> at Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and Judgement to come, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.24, 25. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> lived in his time, and ſo played his pranks in <hi>Rome</hi>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:115738:170"/>that he got to be honoured as a God.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Claudius,</hi> that cruell monſter <hi>Nero</hi> began to reigne, in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4767, on the thirteenth day of <hi>October;</hi> at which time the aforeſaid Emperour dyed, being poyſoned by his wife <hi>Agrippina</hi> through the helpe of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician whoſe name was <hi>Xenophon.</hi> This <hi>Nero</hi> was a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious wicked man; he reigned thirteen years, ſeven mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and 28. dayes; dying by his owne hand on the ninth of <hi>June</hi> in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 1681, one year and 20 dayes before <hi>Veſpaſion</hi> was made Emperour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galba</hi> ſucceeded in the year aforeſaid; whoſe whole time was but ſeven moneths and eight dayes. He was ſlain by <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho,</hi> who (after three moneths and foure dayes) killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being overcome by <hi>Vitellius,</hi> who alſo, after nine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths is ſlain, and <hi>Veſprtian</hi> thereupon ſole Emperour. In the ſecond year of whoſe reigne, that ſtately City and Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed by <hi>Titus,</hi> the gallant and brave ſon of this Emperour, in the year of the <hi>Julian Period</hi> 4783; as more at large, in my firſt Part and laſt Chapter I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: to which I now ſend you. For here I intend no more, but ſhall put an end now even to this Part alſo; giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thanks unto God, who hath brought me unto it.</p>

            <p>And firſt I will begin with <hi>Adam,</hi> of whom I have not much to ſay, and yet if I might not be thought too curious, I could ſhew wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h very much eaſe and probability the very day as well as the yeare of his death. He was not borne nor begotten, but treated in the yeare of the Julian Period <hi>710,</hi> on the <hi>29</hi> day of <hi>April, Feria ſexta,</hi> when the Sun was in the ſixth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Aries,</hi> as I have elſewhere ſhewed: from whence he lived (as the Scripture telleth us) <hi>930</hi> yeares, <hi>Gen. 5.5.</hi> His Death muſt therefore be in the yeare of the ſame period <hi>1640,</hi> at ſuch time as the Sun was againe in the ſame point of Heaven, as at the firſt when God created him: which in this yeare of his death is found to be on the <hi>22</hi> day of <hi>April.</hi> This <hi>22</hi> day in the yeare aforeſaid was on the ſixth day of the week, when was alſo the <hi>14</hi> day of the firſt month. <hi>Adam</hi> therefore dyed on the ſame day of the week on which he was made, which was alſo the ſame day of the month on which I finde it probable that he fell. To which the Teſtimony of <hi>Eutychius</hi> a learned <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> well agreeth, for as hath been told us by that famous and illuſtrious Master <hi>Selden, Adam</hi> died on the ſixth day of the week, and fourteenth day of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth which was neareſt to the Vernall Equinox, as learned <hi>Languius</hi> expounds that paſſage of his taken from <hi>Eutychius</hi> which is indeed an expoſition very true. For thus ſtands the words in Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> Booke <hi>De Anno Judaico,</hi> if they be ſet downe in Engliſh; And <hi>Adam</hi> dyed on <hi>Friday</hi> on the fourteenth day of the <hi>Moonth,</hi> which was the ſixth day of the
<pb facs="tcp:115738:173"/>Moneth <hi>Niſan</hi> &amp;c. By which ſixth day of <hi>Niſan</hi> he certainly meaneth the ſixth day after the Sun entred into <hi>Aries,</hi> at which time muſt be the fourteenth day of the <hi>Moone</hi> and ſixth day of the week. All which I finde to be exactly on the <hi>22</hi> day of <hi>April</hi> aforeſaid, in the yeere of the <hi>Julian Period 1640,</hi> which was therefore the very day and yeere of <hi>Adams</hi> death, and very beginning of the yeare of the <hi>World, 931.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The further conſideration of which is not onely a ſure cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the preciſe time of the creation, but alſo ſerveth to declare that the Ages of the <hi>Patriarches</hi> were full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat yeeres, and that therefore <hi>Noah's Flood</hi> came not in the yeere of the World <hi>1656,</hi> as the most account; but in the yeere of the World <hi>1657.</hi> for <hi>Methuſelah</hi> muſt finiſh the yeeres of his life before it came, as the ſignification of his name in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſheweth; which is, He dyeth, and the emiſſion, or Dart commeth.</p>
            <p>In this yeere of the World (being the yeere of the Julian Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod <hi>2366</hi>) the ſeventeenth day of the ſecond moneth, on which day the <hi>Flood</hi> began, was alſo on the ſixth day of the weeke: which is a character likewiſe worth the marking. For it clearely ſheweth that as on the ſixth day of the weeke, God made both <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Beaſt;</hi> ſo on the ſame day of the week he ſends a flood of Waters to deſtroy them. And as this was on the ſixth day of the week; ſo when <hi>Noah</hi> came out of the Arke was the ſeventh day of the week, in the yeere of the Julian Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod <hi>2367.</hi> on the fifth day of <hi>June,</hi> which in that yeare was the <hi>27</hi> day of the ſecond moneth and Sabbath day: at which time <hi>Noah</hi> offered Sacrifice, even at the very end of a full year of dayes after the flood began: which adds ſtill ſomething for confirmation.</p>
            <p>Another Character next after this confirming me yet more fully in a firm confidence of the truth of my accounts, is taken from the time of the comming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which I finde to be on the laſt day of <hi>Aprill</hi> in the yeare of the Julian Period <hi>3224.</hi> which very day in that yeare was on the ſixth day of the
<pb facs="tcp:115738:173"/>week, even as on the ſame day of the week Chriſt purchaſed a better Redemption by the bloud of his croſſe, one thouſand five hundred and two and twenty yeares after. In all which I doe much admire at the wonderfull providence of God, in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Times ſo exactly and harmoniouſly: for as on the ſixth day of the weeke <hi>Man</hi> was made, and Chriſt ſuffered; ſo on the ſixth day of the weeke <hi>Iſrael</hi> was delivered out of the Egyptian bondage, on the very next day after the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> even as on the next day after the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> Chriſt our <hi>Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> was ſacrificed for us, to free us from the bondage of ſinne and <hi>Sathan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor in this yeare would that character which we have in <hi>Exodus,</hi> from the hiſtory of the Quailes and <hi>Manna,</hi> be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. For as we read in the ſixteenth chapter, on the fifteenth day of the ſecond moneth the people murmured for lacke of meate: whereupon God ſent them <hi>Quailes</hi> at Even, and on the morrow morning <hi>Manna;</hi> which they gathered ſix dayes but on the ſeventh day they found none, <hi>Exod. 16.26.</hi> By which we ſee, not onely that the <hi>22</hi> day of the moneth muſt be Sabbath day, but alſo that the firſt <hi>Manna</hi> fell on the firſt day of the weeke now called the Lords Day in memory of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> Reſurrection, and hath been the Chriſtians Sabbath ever ſince. Which is exactly true in the yeare that I account, if but <hi>29</hi> dayes be reckoned for the firſt moneth, awd <hi>30</hi> for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: which (as I have ſhewed before, in place convenient) is more conſentaneous to the motion of the <hi>Moon,</hi> then to have <hi>30</hi> for the firſt, before the odde houres ariſe to a day; for this could not be before the ſecond moneth. The firſt moneth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any yeare hath but <hi>29</hi> dayes, the ſecond <hi>30,</hi> the third <hi>29,</hi> the fourth <hi>30</hi> &amp;c. For in one moneth (according to the meane motion of the Moon, from one conjunction to another) we have but <hi>29</hi> dayes, <hi>12</hi> houres, <hi>44</hi> minutes, three ſeconds, and <hi>12</hi> thirds. I account therefore that the Iſraelites came out of Egypt, when the <hi>29</hi> day of <hi>April</hi> was ending, and the <hi>30</hi> beginning, which was <hi>Feria ſexta.</hi> I account likewiſe that the
<pb facs="tcp:115738:174"/>firſt <hi>Magna</hi> fell on the <hi>30</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> which was the <hi>16</hi> day of the ſecrnd moneth <hi>Feria prima:</hi> and conſequently that the <hi>29</hi> day of of <hi>May,</hi> and fifth of <hi>June</hi> were Sabbath dayes; the one on the <hi>15</hi> day of the ſecond moneth, and the other on the <hi>22.</hi> And thus is this yeare truly found by the correſpondence we ſee it hath with theſe characters.</p>
            <p>The like confirmation I find for the yeares in which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Temple to be founded and dedicated by King <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and aſter that burnt by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> For firſt it being true, that the Iſraelites came out of Egypt in the yeare of the Julian Period <hi>3224,</hi> it muſt needes follow, that King <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> laid the foundation of the Temple in the yeare of the ſame Period <hi>3703,</hi> for it muſt be in the fourth yeare of King <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> on the ſecond day of the ſecond moneth, <hi>480</hi> yeares cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent after the comming out of Egypt, as we are taught in the <hi>1 Kin. 6.1.</hi> And that being the yeare when it was dedicated (being ſeven yeares after) muſt needs be in the yeare of the ſame Period <hi>3710;</hi> which was not onely ſeven yeares after, but was alſo the eleventh yeare of <hi>Salomon,</hi> as we are likewiſe taught it ſhould be, in the <hi>1 Kin.</hi> chap. <hi>6.</hi> verſe. <hi>38.</hi> and chap. <hi>8.2.</hi> Now this I confirme both by the time that the Temple ſtood, and alſo by the courſes of the Prieſts which ſerved in the ſaid Temple till <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> deſtroyed it. The firſt of theſe is abundantly proved by me to be <hi>423</hi> yeares and ſome odde moneths, which therefore caſteth the deſtruction thereof into the yeare of the Julian Period <hi>4126.</hi> Over and above which proofes of mine, I have ſeen that ſince which I do much admire; namely, that ſome of the skilfull Rabbins have ſaid and recorded it, that the ſame number was heretofore read in the Heavens from ſuch letters as the Starres in their poſition made: For as <hi>Gaffarell</hi> a learned <hi>French man</hi> hath told us, <hi>R. Rapoll, Chomier,</hi> and <hi>Abjudan</hi> have delivered to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity the deepe ſecrets of a caeleſtiall writing and Reading, which diſcovers many ſtrange things to them who are able to underſtand it: and among the reſt this is one, namely, That
<pb facs="tcp:115738:174"/>a little before this Temple we now ſpeake of was deſtroyed and burnt by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> it was obſerved that eleven of the Starres that were moſt verticall to it, compoſed, for a pretty while together, five Hebrew Letters, which being joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made up this word (reading it from the North towards the Weſt) <hi>Hikſchich,</hi> which ſignifieth to reject, and forſake without any Mercy: and the number of three of them added together, amounted to <hi>423,</hi> the very ſpace of Time that this ſtately piece of building had ſtood. All this I finde in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of curioſities of <hi>James Gaffarell,</hi> at the <hi>13</hi> chapter, which whil'ſt I mention I look upon mine own proofes with the more confidence, and though I profeſſe no skill in ſuch curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet I will embrace truth whereſoever I finde it.</p>
            <p>This then for the time of the Temple being thus, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which I have to confirme all elſe about it, is this; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the courſes of the Prieſts which ſerved in the Temple, from the firſt Sabbath of the Dedication, till <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> deſtroyed it. For we may eaſily believe that in the firſt Sabbath of the Dedication, the firſt courſe (which was the courſe of <hi>Joarib</hi>) began, which I have elſewhere proved by the Hebrew and <hi>Julian</hi> Kalender of that yeare (which was the yeare of the Iulian Period <hi>3710</hi>) to be on the <hi>17</hi> day of <hi>October.</hi> To which time and yeare if we adde <hi>224</hi> Iulian yeares (in which ſpace the courſes returne to the ſame day againe) we ſhall come to the yeare of the Julian period <hi>3934.</hi> on the <hi>17</hi> day of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> After which we have <hi>192</hi> yeares more before we can come to the yeare of the Julian period <hi>4126,</hi> in which the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was deſtroyed; noting theſe <hi>192</hi> yeares to end on the <hi>17</hi> of <hi>October</hi> likewiſe. And in <hi>192</hi> yeares we finde <hi>417</hi> courſes with <hi>72</hi> dayes over and above: which <hi>72</hi> dayes being taken out of the number of dayes which were from the beginning of that yeare of the Julian period to the ſaid <hi>17</hi> day of <hi>October,</hi> do direct us to the ſixth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which then was Sabbath day, and the courſe of <hi>Joarib:</hi> even that very courſe of his, in which the Temple was deſtroyed; as before, in the ſeventh
<pb facs="tcp:115738:175"/>Chapter, <hi>pag. 44.45,</hi> &amp;c. may be ſeen.</p>
            <p>But I cannot forget the <hi>423</hi> ſo ſtrangely found out by <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier</hi> for the time of the Temple. <hi>Gaffarell,</hi> out of him hath other periods not impertinent, found out alſo by the foreſaid Reading of the Stars: as that the Kingdome of the Jewes, from the beginning of the <hi>40</hi> yeares given to <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> in the Acts of the Apoſtles, to the deplorable condition of <hi>Zedechia,</hi> ſhould be <hi>505</hi> yeares, for ſo indeed it was, if we reckon from the beginning of the <hi>40</hi> yeare aforeſaid to the time that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> laid his laſt ſiege againſt <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, 430</hi> dayes before the City was taken. This number of <hi>505</hi> he ſaith was ſignified by five ſtars, which compoſed three myſticall letters, out of which was made an Hebrew word whoſe ſignification was to breake, caſt downe, and to drive out: the Number ariſing from thoſe letters being <hi>505.</hi> And why I end them at the foreſaid deplorable condition of <hi>Zedechia</hi> in the time of the ſiege, is, ecauſe this poſition of Stars was ſeen thus and read a little before the Jewes ſaw their Scepter caſt downe to the ground, and their liberty quite carried Captive into <hi>Babylon:</hi> which muſt needs be in the yeare of the Julian period <hi>4125,</hi> when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> laid his laſt ſiege a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus after the ſame manner the length of the Perſian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy founded by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>208</hi> yeares: in which though he may ſeeme to differ two yeares from my account, which preciſely alloweth but <hi>206;</hi> yet he doth abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute <hi>Beroaldus, Broughton,</hi> and ſuch others who would make the world believe that this Monarchy laſted but <hi>130</hi> yeares or thereabouts, whereas it muſt be <hi>206</hi> at the leaſt, and begin (according to <hi>Xenophon</hi>) ſeven yeares before the death of King <hi>Cyrus:</hi> or <hi>208</hi> if we account from the time that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> laid the foundation thereof in conquering <hi>Aſia</hi> and the whol continent about <hi>Babylon,</hi> againſt which he made his laſt expedition two yeares before he tooke it. The notice of which time is not impertinent: for even the prophet had an eye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb facs="tcp:115738:175"/>in Jer. <hi>51.46.</hi> Howbeit the Head of Gold was not as yet quite cut off: for that was not till <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken and <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> ſlaine: not many houres before which, there was an hand-writing upon the wall which told it. Then was as well the firſt yeare of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as of <hi>Darius Medus,</hi> how elſe had <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> been in <hi>Babylon</hi> unto the firſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſeeing upon the Conqueſt <hi>Darius</hi> tooke him with him into <hi>Media,</hi> as <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſheweth: where he was unto the third yeare of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> though how much longer we know not; <hi>Dan. 10.1.</hi> Whereas therefore it is ſaid [in <hi>Dan. 1.21.</hi>] that <hi>Daniel</hi> was unto the firſt yeare of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it is to be underſtood thus; namely, That <hi>Daniel</hi> continued in <hi>Babilon</hi> till that ſtate was altered, and the Kingdome tranſlated to <hi>Cyrus:</hi> who made ſuch a partition thereof between himſelfe and <hi>Darius,</hi> as that <hi>Darius</hi> had the chiefe Title of honour, though he in effect had the dominion. That which we read in the fifth Chapter hath reſpect hereunto; for there we read, not onely that <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> Kingdome was divided, and given to the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Perſians;</hi> but alſo that <hi>Darius Medus</hi> took the Kingdome, being threeſcore and two yeares old, <hi>Dan. 5.28.31.</hi> After which it ſeemeth probable that he lived but a while: not onely becauſe his Climactericall yeare was now at hand, but alſo in regard of the time noted in the date of <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſions. For in this new State, after <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> firſt Viſion in the firſt yeare of <hi>Darius,</hi> when he prayed for the returne of the people from their captivity, there is no more mentioned of any thing dated in the yeares of his Reign, but in the yeares of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> which if <hi>Darius</hi> had been ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, would not have beene; as is eaſie to go grant if we do but conſider that <hi>Darius</hi> tooke <hi>Daniel</hi> away with him into <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Babylon</hi> was conquered, and made him there the chiefeſt Officer of his Kingdome. Nay more, that this firſt yeare of <hi>Darius</hi> muſt be the very yeare likewiſe when <hi>Cyrus</hi> releaſed the captivity, is plain; not onely becauſe now the <hi>70</hi> yeares were accompliſhed, which were both the date of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi> Kingdome
